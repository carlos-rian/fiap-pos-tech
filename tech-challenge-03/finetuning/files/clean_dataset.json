Even the liner notes refer to him  as the \"all-time #1 country album artist.\" To top it off, much of  Nelson's best work--Yesterday's Wine,Shotgun Willie,  andPhases And  Stages, for example--was commercially unsuccessful (not to  mention on a different label). WhileRed-Headed StrangerandStardustdid  make commercial inroads, they're best digested as single entities. With  all that said, these Columbia chart toppers, which span from 1975 to  1989, still make for enchanting listening.

Somewhere soon thereafter, Jones began hitting the bottle and the blow again, and by 1973 he and Wynette were knocking on wood and pledging \"We're Gonna Hold On.\" They did reconcile, but the next year they were lamenting \"We Loved It Away,\" and in 1976 they checked out with the lachrymose \"Golden Ring.\" By 1980 they were feeling more conciliatory toward each other, explaining themselves with the comeback \"Two Story House.\" Great autobiographical track not about the ups and downs of their relationship: \"(We're Not) The Jet Set.\" Here's some country music that means what it says to the people who sang it.--John Morthland"}

{"description": "Here's a career that defies explanation. Ray Price, the father of the Texas shuffle, achieved dance-hall immortality in 1956 with \"Crazy Arms,\" with its walking bass; heavily bowed, single-string fiddle; and slightly tetched lyrics. He may never have topped it, but hits like \"City Lights,\" \"The Other Woman,\" and \"Heartaches by the Number\" proved it was no fluke. Price's big, mellow voice made country music sound erotic. Then in 1967 he threw away his honky-tonk reign with \"Danny Boy\" of all things, cut with a 47-piece orchestra. That one may have left something to be desired, but his 1970 reading ofKris Kristofferson's \"For the Good Times\" was certainly as earthy and compelling as Countrypolitan got. It's hard not to want more Harlan Howard and Hank Cochran songs, and less Jim Weatherly, but Price is as contrary as country stars come, and this set represents him accurately.--John Morthland", "title": "16 Biggest Hits"}
{"description": "In the third decade of his career, already long famous, George Jones followed his new lover Tammy Wynette to Epic, where he offered his incomparable voice to her producer, Billy Sherrill.

This 16-track set skips far too many Jones-Sherrill highlights (and it oddly includes \"Radio Lover,\" one \"biggest hit\" that was never a hit at all), but it's the only one-disc set to provide an overview of the team's entire 17-year partnership.

{"description": "Though it was relatively short, Johnny Horton's career may have been too broad based to make a bare-bones package like this work, but it sure comes close. Horton is best known for the saga songs (\"The Battle of New Orleans,\" \"Sink the Bismark\") he scored with when Nashville latched onto the early-'60s folk revival. But the rockabilly set often claims him for the heated trucker's romp \"I'm Coming Home,\" and his first hit was an uptown arrangement of the relaxed, swaying \"Honky-Tonk Man.\" The main thing binding all his material was his smooth, flexible voice, which could go from a low, light growl to a high hic. It was also smooth enough that Horton could make the countryest material sound pop when he wanted to.

Sony has used this &quot;16 Most Requested&quot; routine on a number of their easy-listening vocalists (including Sinatra and Andy Williams), but this one is special in that it takes the cream of Mathis'sGreatest Hitsalbum and rounds it out with his 1970s take on several movie theme hits, includingLove StoryandRomeo & Juliet.A truly unique and romantic sound.--Bill Holdship"}
{"title": "16 Most Requested Songs", "description": "TheEllington Centenaryin 1999 brought renewed attention to a unique musical legacy, producing a host of definitive reissues and tribute recordings. However, this modest, single-CD compilation remains an excellent introduction to Duke Ellngton's work as composer and bandleader, two indistinguishable roles. It includes many of the original recordings of his most familiar songs, reaching back to the 1930s for the swinging \"It Don't Mean a Thing\" and the exotic \"Caravan\" and forward to the 1950s for \"Satin Doll.\" The first 10 tracks appear here in their original monaural sound, and they're an authentic account of the early years of Ellington's marvelous band--with the rich, smooth saxophone textures ofJohnny Hodgesand Harry Carney, the soaring muted trumpets of Cootie Williams andRex Stewart, and the unadorned musicality of Ivie Anderson's voice. If you want a CD with just the most famous tunes, or if you want to introduce someone to Ellington's music in all its regal brilliance, this is a good place to start.--Stuart Broomer"}

On the earlier tracks, Billie's a gritty but fairly ordinary jazz singer with a few nifty devices, though the bands are ace (they include Benny Goodman, Lester Young, and members of Duke Ellington and Count Basie's groups), and she swings like she rarely would later on. By the end of the disc, though, the classics start coming--&quot;Gloomy Sunday,&quot; &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;--and the deep, abiding sadness that made her great emerges.--Douglas Wolk"}
{"description": "This compilation features a lot ofRosemary Clooney's early novelty-ish songs (\"Mambo Italiano\" is so dumb that it's enjoyable) but also plenty of her signature ballads. The contrast can be jarring. Between \"Botch-a-Me (Ba-Ba-Baciani Piccina)\" and the following track, \"Hey There,\" we hear two completely different singers. (Of course the songs themselves might as well be from different planets.) It's the Clooney we hear on \"Hey There\" who's the best known now: the sultry interpreter of love songs. But Clooney also had an imperial grip on midtempo numbers, as her assured performance on \"Be My Life's Companion\" shows. This CD is a good starting point (at a budget price) for those who want a basic overview of Clooney's career; those further along the path might want to look into a couple of the albums she recorded with Nelson Riddle: 1965's masterpiece of longingLove, or 1961's brassy, upbeatRosie Solves the Swingin' Riddle!.--Elisabeth Vincentelli", "title": "16 Most Requested Songs"}

{"description": "When Mel Torme was recording for Columbia in the mid-1960s, he was singing both contemporary pop tunes and standards. This disc concentrates wisely on the standards, and they're almost all ballads with string settings by Robert Mersey. Torme's voice had matured into a perfect musical instrument for this repertoire, a smooth, warm sound that suggested the best tenor saxophonists and blended with his flawless diction to caress the lyrics. Porter's \"I've Got You Under My Skin\" gets a more upbeat Latin treatment, but it's Torme's way with a ballad, rather than his jazz singing that's featured here, and virtually every great songwriter in the canon is represented. This CD includes the originalThat's AllLP, which has since beenreissuedwith additional tracks. --Adam Rains", "title": "16 Most Requested Songs"}

Four tracks come from Goodman'sLive at Carnegie Hall 1938, and they're all extended performances, climaxing with the 12-minute version of \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\"Gene Krupa's driving tom-toms defining the excitement of the era.

But their stubborn perseverance (and that of founding guitarist Kim Simmonds) has made them one of the longest-lived rock bands ever, and--for better or worse--the spiritual inspiration of generations of hard-slogging bar bands the world over. This 11-track anthology culls the best of Brown's '69-'72 prime years, highlighted by their bluesy reworking of the Temptations \"I Can't Get Next to You,\" the greasy-rhythmed epic \"Hellbound Train,\" and its lugubrious, primitive cousin, \"Train to Nowhere.\" The uneasy footing spawned by the band's notorious personnel problems (guitarist Dave Peverett and drummer Roger Earl, who appear on the bulk of tracks here, went on to form fellow bar-godsFoghat) actually helped extend the expiration date of their obviously limited formula. The slide-guitar-driven \"lost\" classic \"Tell Mama\" is also ample testimony to the power of Savoy Brown when it slipped from its strict blues base and locked into a rollicking rock groove; few bar bands ever sounded so good.--Jerry McCulley"}

Still, the duo and their Foggy Mountain Boys attack this music with an urgency that even Monroe's Blue Grass Boys were hard-pressed to equal. Scruggs's three-fingered banjo technique is as important to bluegrass as any other innovation, possessing a rolling quality that keeps the songs moving. \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" and \"Farewell Blues\" are banjo tour de forces that will never be matched. Original gospel numbers find Scruggs applying his fingerpicking technique to guitar, &agrave; laMerle Travis, and feature sharp group harmonies.

This blade leaves a lovely finish on the crown of the head and the arch of the neck of a cocker spaniel. Blade sets should be oiled once a day minimum! Ideally, it should be done before every grooming. After oiling, be sure to use a soft, dry cloth to wipe any oil off the external surfaces to reduce the possibility of getting it on the animal's coat. If the clipper blades leave streaks or slow down, it's a sure sign that the blades need oil. Oiling Blades - Place a few drops of blade oil on the front and side of the cutter blades. Wipe excess oil off blades with a soft, dry cloth. Spray lubricants contain insufficient oil for good lubrication, but are an excellent clipper blade coolant. Cleaning Blades - Immerse blades only while clipper is running in a shallow pan of clipper oil or blade cleaner. After cleaning, turn the clipper off and dry blades with a clean, dry cloth.

Yet after each downturn, Cocker has rebounded to new heights. No mere pretty face he, Cocker's incomparable bluesy rasp and eccentric stage mannerisms (once described as a \"bad case of muscular dystrophy exacerbated by Parkinson's disease\") have made him a favorite of musical impressionists from John Belushi toBilly Joel. But Cocker's evocative voice and unique phrasing have no peer.The Anthologytraces the singer from his first single (a surprisingly faithful 1964 cover ofLennon-McCartney's \"I'll Cry Instead\") to the heights of \"Feelin' Alright\" to the worldwide No. 1Jennifer Warnesduet \"Up Where We Belong.\" Add to the list manic collaborations with ringmasterLeon Russelland the legendaryMad Dogs and Englishmanperiod, highlighted by Cocker's brilliant interpretation of \"With A Little Help From My Friends\" and covers of \"The Letter,\" \"Honky Tonk Women,\" and \"Cry Me A River.\" Like most gifted jazz and blues singers, Cocker can take the most shopworn standard and make it his own. Though it sidesteps the singer's late '80's and 90's output, this 37-track collection offers up the gifted Cocker in his various permutations and makes a sound case that this is a singer for the ages.--Jerry McCulley"}

At a time when her counterculture peers were singing about buildings going up in flames, 26-year-old Carly focused on the glow from her brooding father's cigarette as she slipped by his study. \"That's the Way\" was the first of a string of top-10 hits Simon produced through the '70s and into the '80s.Anthologyincludes the lot of them--from \"Anticipation\" through \"You're So Vain\" past \"Let the River Run\" (better known as the theme fromWorking Girl). Far surpassing the 10-song Elektra retrospective,The Best of Carly Simon, this two-disc, 40-song collection spans three decades in the career of an artist who clearly believes that confession is good for the soul.--Steven Stolder", "title": "Anthology"}
{"description": "In retrospect, making 11-year-oldMichael Jacksoninto a sex symbol was maybe not such a good idea, but it made for some  great records with his brothers in the first half of the '70s.Anthologyis the first compilation in ages to treat the Jackson  5 as a band rather than a franchise--meaning no solo records, thoughJermaine's cover ofShep and  the Limelites' \"Daddy's Home\" gets gerrymandered in via a  live-in-Japan recording--and as an album act rather than just a factory  for turning The Corporation's songs (like \"ABC\" and \"I Want You Back\")  into hits. It includes all their big singles, but it also plumbs the  archive for noteworthy B-sides and album tracks, of which there turn  out to be plenty: some ridiculous (a make-way-for-the-new-generation  anthem called \"The Young Folks,\" hollered convincingly by a  prepubescent Michael), some startling (who'd have thought they coveredFunkadelic?), some  both (a bouncy take onJackson Browne's  \"Doctor My Eyes\"). The second disc is especially juicy, documenting the 1973-74 period when the Jacksons fell into the hands of  producer Hal Davis and turned out some fantastic, long psychedelic-funk  jams, eventually streamlining their new approach into the megahit  \"Dancing Machine.\"--Douglas Wolk", "title": "Anthology"}
{"description": "It's no wonder that some of the college students and twentysomething youngsters who have given free jazz a shot in the arm are revisiting the fusion movement (sometimes simultaneously, as withMedeski Martin & Wood). The music reflects all the impetuousness and energy of youth and combines it with the technical maturity that can match the most seasoned avant-garde improviser. If there was such a thing as a pure fusion musician, it was the 21-year-old Al Di Meola at the start of this two-CD compilation. While withReturn to Forever, the young guitarist honed his high-flying, hard-rocking style, moving further along with a group that first featured Barry Miles, thenJan HammerandPhilipe Saisseon keyboards. Di Meola also had the knack of aptly titling his fiery compositions with descriptions, like \"Race with Devil on Spanish Highway,\" \"Alien Chase on Arabian Desert,\" \"Elegant Gypsy,\" and \"Island Dreamer.\" Expertly sequenced and annotated by Bill Milkowski, the unofficial biographer of the fusion movement, this 20-track retrospective includes four unreleased live tracks, including an incredible reading of the RTF anthem \"Theme to the Mothership.\" The anthology is also instructive in tracing the development of the style (from 1976 to 1983) that eventually turned Jan Hammer into a pop star through theMiami Vicesoundtrack.--Mark Ruffin", "title": "Anthology"}

{"description": "The storyThe John Lennon Anthologytells--that of the questing former Beatle who took five years off to raise his son before returning with an album of peaceful reflections on the househusband life--isn't new, but for all its monumental status, it does help bring Lennon into focus again as a person and a musician. Since his murder in 1980, Lennon-the-man-of-peace has too often obscured the rocker, the dad, the flawed human being in the public consciousness. While this massive stock of odds and ends--studio outtakes and chatter, live and alternate versions, demos--is necessarily diffuse, it does a great service. It restores the iconic Lennon to normal size.Some of the set's most striking moments come at its beginning, in eight previously unreleased takes of songs that filled most of 1970'sPlastic Ono Band. One of rock's most uncompromised albums, it found him angry, sad, and reflective to bursting. The tapes included onAnthology, though, feature a Lennon who, if not happy, is fully in his element--making rock & roll. Even as he's making dry runs for exorcising demons, he's still the guy who fell for the music as a Liverpool teenager; on an early, shuffling version of \"Hold On,\" he leads his guitar line into the main riff of Bill Doggett's \"Honky Tonk.\"Elsewhere, we get long looks at the fits and starts of Lennon's years as a solo artist and as part of a duo with Yoko Ono. He slips from the grace of \"Imagine\" and \"It's So Hard\" into the raw polemics and lousy rhymes of \"John Sinclair\" and \"Attica State.\" (Contrary to a stage announcement preceding the latter, it's not this failed anthem that has ensured the ongoing memory of the prison massacre.)The honesty of Lennon's vocals throughout his career is often commented on, and they provide some of the greatest treasure here. Whether an alternate of the pained 1974 \"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out,\" the joyfully full-on rocking of \"Be Bop a Lula\" and \"Move Over Ms. L,\" or a gorgeous \"Be My Baby,\" it's the voice that's the window to this man's soul. We also see how pained he was at his temporary separation from Yoko, as he even inserts a line of \"Jealous Guy\" into the demo for the rollicking \"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\" and abashed pleads for \"one more chance\" on a similar tape of \"Mind Games.\"Finally, there are the many moments of good humor--the outlines of \"I'm the Greatest\" and \"Goodnight Vienna\" for Ringo, the loose-as-a-goose \"Be Bop a Lula\"--and pleasingly bad, like \"Serve Yourself,\" a snipe at Dylan's born-again phase, or some battling studio exchanges with a Phil Spector crazed enough to drive anyone out of the business for half a decade.Anthologyis flawed, but its wide-ranging picture of Lennon's post-Beatles years is that of someone you'd love to have spent some time with.--Rickey Wright", "title": "Anthology"}
{"description": "The two-disc, 34-trackAnthologycould be subtitled \"The Crossover Decades,\" for it covers the years when B.B. King (like his \"Sweet Little Angel\") spread his wings. Spanning the era 1962-1998, the set begins when King was a recording veteran whose renown was confined to the blues ghetto. Applying vocal grit and guitar sting to the dramatic call-and-response of his material, King won rock converts with hisLive at the Regalalbum (represented here by two highlights), climbed the pop charts with the string-laced \"The Thrill Is Gone,\" employed the jazz grooves of theCrusadersand the soul tinge of theMemphis Horns, and even invaded MTV withU2's \"When Love Comes to Town.\" More scattershot survey than comprehensive career summary, this collection isn't as consistent as King's single-disc hits compilations or as expansive as his four-discKing of the Bluesbox, but it amply documents his staying power.--Don McLeese", "title": "Anthology"}
{"title": "Anthology", "description": "This 16-song collection on two LPs was the way that a lot of people first picked up on the Quicksilver Messenger Service. Without a string of charting singles to help drive album sales in the manner that the Jefferson Airplane enjoyed, their original LPs mostly passed unnoticed outside of the locales where they played regularly. But for those who came along a little later, here were most of the highlights of the band's first six LPs, opening with \"Pride of Man,\" \"Dino's Song,\" etc., and all in a cool-looking silver-on-black jacket that, one suspects, just may have influenced the design of the Grateful Dead's What a Long Strange Trip It's Been some four years later.

{"description": "Though his audience isn't as big as it used to be, George Thorogood has, at the very least, attained minor-legend status. After all, was there anyone who sawTerminator 2anddidn'trecognize \"Bad to the Bone\" from the very opening riff?

But Thorogood has always made up for in enthusiasm and energy anything he might have lacked in technique. It's likely that more people have heard his versions of \"One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer,\" \"Reelin' and Rockin',\" \"Who Do You Love?,\" and \"If You Don't Start Drinkin' (I'm Gonna Leave)\" than the originals.

That's a shame, because Hiatt has forged one of the most consistently satisfying canons of any contemporary American singer-songwriter. This double-disc, 40-song anthology charts Hiatt's sometimes stormy, always compelling course across more than a half-dozen record labels and nearly as many styles. Beginning with his early days as a Nashville hired gun (including \"Sure As I'm Sittin' Here,\" a songThree Dog Nighttook to the top 20), this collection's first disc documents Hiatt's restless early career, which bounded off earlyDylan(who covered the songwriter's \"The Usual\") andStonesinfluences, through nascent L.A. punk, and on to healthy Elvis obsessions (bothPresleyandCostello); indeed, songs like \"My Edge of the Razor\" and \"She Loves the Jerk\" sound like Costello outtakes. The second chapter chronicles Hiatt boiling off his rich, disparate influences in the mid-'80s to find his own true voice--and again forging successes for others with songs, like his sly original version ofBonnie Raitt's comeback hit, \"Thing Called Love.\" By the collection's final tracks (\"Take It Down\" and \"Crossing Muddy Waters,\" from the 2000albumnamed after the latter), Hiatt had come full circle, again embracing his country-blues roots, but in a stripped-down acoustic setting that only underscored his gifts of observation and musical storytelling.--Jerry McCulley", "title": "Anthology"}

It has to be said that the early Genesis were, and always will, remain a fave with the hard core of Genesis fans. The latter, and unofficially renamed the Phil Collins Band seem now to have become hardly a passing phase. Phillips quit to stage fright, allegedly, although listening to this album it's a good thing he did! (we might not have had such a catalogue of Phillips' solo albums). As you may well have gathered, Anthology is an album that has a selection of songs, or pieces from either existing or to-be-released albums on Blueprint. And, as such, it's a very eclectic mix of material. One or two pieces are firmly entrenched in the 70s (down to the instruments rather than the songs), whereas others are simply timeless. Not only is this a great album to play any time, it's also a good way of checking out his work - very overlooked, if I might say. Correct it now."}
{"description": "While funkified R&B; orchestras of the late '70s and early '80s such as Earth, Wind & Fire and the Commodores made frequent appearances on the mainstream charts, Maze hold a special place in the hearts of nostalgic R&B; fans because the San Francisco-based seven-piece (later eight-piece) band always stayed exclusive to its loyal core audience--the many thousands of mostly adult, mostly black, mostly working-class fans who made each of Maze's 10 albums gold without the help of a huge pop hit. Soul fans who heard about only the crossovers missed out on Maze's medium-funk grooves and the buttery-thick Philly-style vocals of featured performer/bandleader Frankie Beverly. Thankfully, the two-discAnthologycollects the singles that, depending on what neighborhood you grew up in, may never have made it as far as they should have. Covering, in chronological order, all of Maze's recordings for Capitol--from 1977's self-titled debut to 1986'sLive in Los Angeles--Anthologyprovides just about all the Maze anyone short of a collector would need. Disc One is preferable, with its classic '70s soul (&quot;While I'm Alone&quot;), down-home grooves (&quot;Workin' Together&quot;), and gritty deep-fried jams (&quot;Southern Girl&quot;). Disc Two features their bigger R&B; chart hits, such as the late-career high point &quot;Back in Stride&quot; and songs from the mid-'80s, when the band had overproduced its up-tempo stuff into a synth-damaged pulp (&quot;Love Is the Key&quot;) and its slow songs into doctor's-office slush (&quot;Your Own Kind of Way&quot;).

It is a ship specially designed by Jeth's parents to navigate and explore the Belgrave, a sector of space that gives off inexplicable power fluctuations; many consider it haunted. Jeth is finally given the opportunity to captain the Avalon when the crew are sent into the Belgrave to salvage a stranded Confederation ship said to hold a dangerous weapon. Little does he know that this mission will set off a chain of events that could have far-reaching consequences and fundamentally challenge his understanding of his own family's history. This is an exciting piece of science fiction that keeps up its energy from beginning to end. Fans of the short-lived but beloved Joss Whedon television show Firefly will find this book especially enjoyable, and it is sure to be one of the most popular releases in the genre this year.&#x2014;Ryan F.

Combining live-action set in a dystopian near future (filmed in Poland) and digital imagery set within a state-sponsored virtual combat game called Avalon, this sluggishly paced but visually dazzling film is another brain-teaser from the director ofGhost in the Shell. The action focuses on a maverick Avalon ace named Ash (played by the lovely Polish actress Malgorzata Foremniak) who advances to the game's highest and most mysterious level, \"Class Real,\" a virtual world so authentically convincing that some--called \"the Unreturned\"--choose never to leave it. As with theMatrixtrilogy,Avalonis more intriguing in premise than execution, filled with hushed tones and heavy-handed portent. Still, the amber-hued ruins of Oshii's virtual landscape are oddly alluring as a means of escape--a warning from Oshii, perhaps, that even the most exciting virtual reality is a trap that can prove deadly to those who fall into it willingly.--Jeff Shannon"}

READ CAREFULLY : A.M.O. RECURVE BOW STRING LENGTH DEFINED: THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL LENGTH OF THE BOW STRING WILL BE 4\" SHORTER THAN THE A.M.O. LENGTH. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ORDER A 52\" A.M.O LENGTH BOW STRING THE ACTUAL STRING LENGTH WILL BE 48\" MEASURED AT 100 LBS TENSION General Recurve & Longbow Bowstring Guidelines As a rule of thumb most Dacron ( B-50 ) recurve bowstrings measured out of the package and not under tension will be approximately 4\" less than the AMO ( Archery Manufacturer's Organization ) bow length. Longbows are generally 3\" less. A Dacron Bowstring (B-50) which depending on overall length will stretch up to an inch under 100 lbs of tension and will look \"out of the package\" like it is approximately 4 inches or more shorter than the bow. This is the reason you hear people speak about bowstrings being 4 inches shorter than the bow length. Endless loop type string lengths can be adjusted slightly by twisting or untwisting them, this allows for minor overall length variations. If your unsure of the length needed you can take your old string that has been unstrung from your bow and take the measurement from tip of loop end to the other tip loop end \"tip to tip\" while stretching it out hand tight with no slack in your string ( make sure the loops are flattened closed and extended out to give the greatest length possible ) assuming this will give you the approximate actual length of your string, now you can add 4\" to this measurement anf find your approximate AMO LENGTH. If you do not have a string on the bow and nothing printed on the bow handle or limb giving you the \"AMO\" length you can do a little research by trying to contact the bow manufacturer or doing a internet search on how to measure bowstring length, but once again as a rule of thumb the above guidelines are standard and should work in most cases."}

{"description": "On this mix, progressive house-trance DJ Danny Tenaglia goes for an organic, R&B-tinged; sound, incorporatingOleta AdamsandCe Ce Penistonwith other, more esoteric selections. The source material isn't manipulated via turntables, EQ'ing, and scratch mixing, but rather filtered through sequenced and produced studio processes. The result is often effective and devastatingly sensual, like when the hypnotic \"Going Round\" coalesces with an understated, shuffling rhythm, building into a dreamy, echo-laden fadeout. Tenaglia's selections alternately benefit and suffer without the layers of house beats and atmospherics that usually disguise a song's less compelling aspects. \"Rhythm of Life\" pulses with Adams's huge alto, playing off a spare set of piano chords and understated bongo drums, but \"Bang Bang Your Mine\" sounds silly, as a nakedly inane vocal line is left to cringe in the cold light of an unforgiving mix.

{"title": "Beauty and the Beast", "description": "Grade 1-4-- Poor Beauty! Poor Beast! de Beaumont's popular and highly romantic story of a noble, but hideously ugly beast who wins the love of gentle, kind-hearted Beauty suffers badly from poorly executed illustrations . In Howard's lengthy but smooth and coherent text, the greed and jealousy of Beauty's sisters, the consequences of the family's misfortunes, and the splendors of the Beast's palace are faithfully described in complex, stately language. A slightly ironic tone allows de Beaumont's voice to come through clearly, reflecting her \"moralistic\" commentary on the hypocrisy and pretentions of the society she knew. While the text is nicely modulated and suited to the story, Knight's illustrations are quite another matter, featuring vapid faces, awkward figures, and uninspired composition. In places, they misrepresent the story and, overall, they destroy any sense of drama or magic that the text provides. Beauty's father, described as \"wise,\" looks merely foolish. The Beast, despite his pivotal importance to the story, is truly unexceptional and fails to evoke any real terror. In fact, the garish, saccharine-sweet colors give the whole book an unpleasant and inappropriately cartoonlike character.

But what she doesn't know is that his surprising kindness might also capture her heart."}
{"title": "Beauty and the Beast", "description": "This beloved old French fairy tale has enjoyed renewed popularity in recent years. Beauty, as you may recall, is the youngest daughter of a devoted father who has fallen on hard times. Returning from a journey, he picks a rose for his daughter, enraging the owner of the rosebush, the fearsome boarlike Beast who inhabits a nearby castle. As payment for the rose, Beauty must leave her family and reside in the Beast's castle as his companion. She gradually comes to appreciate the Beast's kind nature, and, after leaving him to visit her family, realizes that she has fallen in love! Beauty willingly returns to her Beast, in time to break the spell that has caused his current, beastly countenance and restore him (and the servants in the castle) to their human forms.Jan Brett--well-known for her artistry inGoldilocks and the Three BearsandThe Mitten--has worked her usual magic on this beautiful edition ofBeauty and the Beast. In a unique visual spin on the story, the tapestries hung on the walls of the Beast's castle reveal the true identities of the animal servants who are under the same spell as the Beast--a subtle, fascinating feature that may not be noticed until the second or third reading. The story's old-fashioned and graceful language perfectly accompanies the French court setting. One of the finest takes on this classic tale, Brett'sBeauty and the Beastis described byKirkus Reviewsas &quot;a lovely, carefully made edition of an old favorite.&quot;(Ages 5 to 8)--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

{"title": "Believe", "description": "Cher's recording career has long taken a back seat to her acting pursuits, but withBelieveshe's back with a vengeance as a throbbing disco diva. Although no fewer than five producers with dance pedigrees are along for the project (including Todd Terry, Junior Vasquez of Madonna fame, and Rob Dickins, who helped resurrect Rod Stewart's ailing career), this is by no means a dance album in the '90s trip-hop sense of the term. Rather, it's a tour de force that summons mid-'70s images of strobe-lighted dance floors, sequined miniskirts, and writhing bodies. In \"Power,\" Cher wails, \"Ain't nothing changed much through the years.\" Not a bad thing in this case, since Cher's star was still rising in the steamy '70s and '80s with a string of hits that included the disco gem \"Take Me Home\" and the haunting \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\" Although not blessed with much vocal range, Cher knows how to work a song with her trademark sultry, slightly ironic delivery.  And she's certainly in fine form on the masterful title track, which is marred only by the intrusive, anachronistic wah-wah vocal effect.--Jaan Uhelszki"}

This unique mixture of passion and elegance has resulted in making him one of the top selling artists in the alternative market.  Classically trained since the age of five, Pandolfi took a road-less-traveled by most serious artists and created his own inspiring arrangements of Popular Music. He began recording them in 1991, and has accumulated a catalog of 25 different albums and compilations.  Without a doubt, when you hear the music of Emile Pandolfi, you will experience the heart and soul of one of todays finest pianists.", "title": "Believe"}

Here, once again, the band's imperious chrome-domed vocalist David Draiman bleats out the band's messages of nonconformity, self-empowerment, and individuality with a passion and ferocity that hasn't been heard since the '60s--though there's little room for peace, love, and understanding in Disturbed's world. Instead, Draiman laces the band's message with equal parts rage, disgust, and menace, all delivered in a thundering voice that alternates from the lyrical to the grizzled.Ozzy Osbournehas called Disturbed the \"future of metal,\" and he might be right; they have almost single-handedly plucked the genre out of the aggro dung heap and fueled it with intelligence. The band is just as aggressive here as on their debut, but they've lost some of their dark angst, and as a result have created a melodic, psychically lighter album, despite the fact that the CD kicks off with \"Prayer,\" a conversation between Draiman and God, inspired by the singer's grandfather's death.--Jaan Uhelszki"}

{"title": "Beowulf", "description": "Beowulf 's action-heavy and single-minded take on heroism makes it an appealing choice for younger readers, while posing the challenge of tempering the intensity of the violent, limb-rending bloodbaths that make up much of the story. Rumford's version only lightly drips with gore, though, as he is more focused on preserving the language of the eighth-century epic. He carefully deploys only words derived from the Anglo-Saxon of the original&#x97;those that evoke a simpler, sterner, and more perilous age, and retells the tale in an evenly measured cadence, which sounds great read aloud in as booming a voice as possible. The busy pen-and-ink artwork, while rough, is suitably dramatic and expressive, washed by pestilential sage-hued greens, murky underwater blues, and the golden whorls of dragon's breath. Rumford is obviously passionate about the source and admirably encourages readers to seek out the original, whose ancient words will make the night darker, the shadows deeper, and, perhaps, your heart bolder. This fine introduction may inspire them to do just that. Chipman, Ian"}
{"description": "Beowulftranslates the ancient epic poem of the same name into a postapocalypticRoad Warrior-style future, in which a military outpost is being invaded by a monstrous, blood-thirsty creature. Drawn hither by the evil emanations comes Beowulf (Christopher Lambert fromSubwayand theHighlanderseries), a powerful warrior with dark secrets of his own. There he meets the beautiful Kyra (Rhona Mitra), a woman warrior with a couple of cleavage-revealing outfits. Her father Hrothgar, meanwhile, is haunted by dreams of a blond, seminaked succubus with crimped hair, who has some mysterious connection to the murdering monster. Everyone, even father and daughter, has a different accent. It's all pretty trashy--the script is full of bravura lines like, \"The only thing that keeps me from becoming evil is fighting evil\"--but the cinematography and special effects are capable, there are lots of cool-looking swords and weaponry, and there's some pleasantly cheesy techno-metal music that plays intermittently for no good reason. Christopher Lambert, with white hair and a full-length leather duster, looks a little bored, but he's still his competent brooding action-hero self. If you enjoyedMortal Kombat, this is right up your alley.--Bret Fetzer", "title": "Beowulf"}

{"description": "Finally, the long awaited recording is made! Since 1990, Benjamin Bagby has been performing the great epic Beowulf at major festivals and venues around the world. Now we have his remarkable performance on DVD, beautifully filmed by the award-winning Swedish director Stellan Olsson.While Beowulf has come down to us as literature, as a written poem, the epic's pre-literate medieval audience would have known it through the performance of a scop, a bardic storyteller, as Bagby presents himself here. In this one-man tour de force Bagby accompanies himself on an Anglo-Saxon harp. Using the entire range of his voice, he delivers this gripping tale in Old English, as it could have been experienced more than one thousand years ago.This is a performance which speaks to the lovers of Beowulf and oral epic, early music enthusiasts, Tolkien fans, medievalists, and anyone searching for virtuoso storytelling or a glimpse into the fascinating beginnings of the English language.", "title": "Beowulf"}
{"description": "Grade 7 Up&ndash;Morpurgo retells the classic story of the courageous young warrior from the land of Geats (now southern Sweden) who used his brute strength to save the neighboring Danes, then his own kinsmen, by slaying two horrible monsters, a sea serpent, and a massive dragon. The tale has been divided into three segments: the story of the monster Grendel's defeat; the slaying of his mother, the sea-hag; and the battle with the death dragon of the deep. Morpurgo has retold the tale in twisting, long-winded sentences that call to mind the way in which old epics were recounted by poets and bards. The text-filled pages framed with a Celtic-style border are broken up with small watercolor illustrations tucked here and there to help move things along. Many attractive full-page watercolor and pastel paintings illustrate important action-filled scenes&ndash;battles, a banquet, and Beowulf's funeral pyre. Morpurgo's short acknowledgment states that his inspiration for this version of the Old English classic came from the likes of Seamus Heaney, Rosemary Sutcliffe, and Kevin Crossley-Holland. The lack of introductory material and historical background is noticeable but overall this is a fine retelling.&ndash;Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OHCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Beowulf", "description": "The king of heroic epics gets a lavish visual interpretation in Hinds's full-color mixed-media gem, originally self-published as three separate issues in 2000. He begins with a credit to two versions of the familiar story (A.J. Church's 1904 translation and that of Francis Gummere), in which a vicious monster named Grendel terrorizes the great hall of King Hrothgar for 12 winters, and the hero Beowulf arrives from afar, to try to defeat the creature and succeeds&mdash;with his bare hands. Then he must contend with Grendel's mother, when she comes to avenge her son's fate; the third chapter deals with the mournful end to the hero's life, resulting from a battle with an enormous dragon. Each chapter begins with a brief narrative (paying homage to the cadences of the story's early verse renditions), before giving way to a lengthy, wordless and bloody battle. Hinds's angular perspectives and unusual color palettes (dark, ruddy colors, deep burgundy blood, and not a ray of sunshine in sight) lend the book an almost overwhelming sense of menace. The third and most emotionally forceful chapter centers around an incredible two-page spread that shows the dragon awakening; it's an arresting image in a book filled with many. For fantasy fans both young and old, this makes an ideal introduction to a story without which the entire fantasy genre would look very different; many scenes may be too intense for very young readers.

{"description": "This graceful prose retelling of Beowulf dramatizes the hero's defeat of Grendel and Grendel's mother, his slaying of the dragon threatening his people, and his death scene, in which he appoints his young kinsman Wiglaf as the heir to his throne. In an effort to involve young readers, Canadian novelist Katz tells the story in third person from Wiglaf's point of view... completely absorbing. A handsome volume. --American Library Association, December 1, 1999Welwyn Wilton Katz's prose retelling of this poem is, quite simply, stunning. She uses the young Wiglaf, Beowulf's loyal 14-year-old companion at the time of his death (his other companions, warriors all, had fled) as the conduit for the story. Lively conversations between Wiglaf and his grandfather, an Elder of the Waegmunding clan, advance this heroic tale in a wonderfully engrossing way. Lazslo Gal's pale, ethereal paintings, beautiful in themselves, are a cool counterpoint to the heated and bloody action. --Globe and Mail, October 2, 1999This classic Norse legend comes brilliantly to life in Lazslo Gal's striking artwork as Welwyn Katz retells the timeless tale of Beowulf who, like his only remaining close kin (young Wiglaf and Aelfhere) is endowed with a magical gift. But these gifts are also a terrible burden. Beowulf's superhuman strength makes him clumsy and even overpowers his own weapons; Aelfhere's ability to read men's minds reveals disturbing truths; and Wiglaf's true-life dreams foretell disaster. Wiglaf hears about many of Beowulf's adventures, and then is a participant himself in the final and deadly battle with a dragon. True in tone and style to the great Norse sagas, this edition of Beowulf is an outstanding introduction for today's young readers to an ancient tale of true and mythic heroism against incredible and equally mythic evils. --Children's Bookwatch, USA, December 1999", "title": "Beowulf"}

With the instrumentation of piano, guitar, and bass, the group combined light textures and solid swing, and guitarist Oscar Moore, one of the first to master the single-string possibilities of the electric instrument, was Cole's equal as an improviser. Ranging from 1942 to 1950, this three-CD set is an excellent compilation of the trio's recordings, with the first disc devoted to instrumentals and the other two to vocals. From the sly irony of \"Meet Me at no Particular Place\" to the warmth and immediacy of \"You're the Cream in my Coffee,\" the music possesses a charm that's rooted in its period but which extends far beyond it.--Stuart Broomer"}

Bookended by her Hollywood musical iconsCabaretandTheme From New York, New York, and seasoned with Broadway tributes like \"All That Jazz,\" it also contains a healthy cross-sampling of her compelling live work (ranging from the show-stopping \"Some People\" to the precocious effervescence ofLiza With a Z). Though the disco-affectations of \"Losing My Mind\" confirm she was never able to capture the pop zeitgeist of the moment with the chameleonic ease of Streisand, her interpretations of \"Quiet Thing\" and \"Maybe This Time\" argue she was every inch her rival's equal as a torch singer.--Jerry McCulley", "title": "Best of"}

{"title": "Best of", "description": "The Best of Groove Armadacharts the success of one of the UK's most popular dance acts. Featuring the biggest hits from their last three albums, this anthology of their time on the Jive label is packed with downbeat and upbeat anthems, and an array of music as heard in film, television and radio.The subdued intro and trombone melody of \"Superstylin\" opens the collection softly with the now legendary bassline kicking in for a perfect euphoric moment. Other upbeat anthems include the piano house of \"If Everybody Looked the Same,\" theFatboy Slimmix of Gramma Funk's \"I See You Baby\" (both of which have been used to sell cars) and the more recent disco hit, \"Easy.\" However, although Tom Findlay and Andy Kato pack dance floors every weekend, it's their downbeat soul that receives most attention, partly due to the \"chillout\" explosion of 2000 that made \"At the River\" a classic of the genre. With their last albumLovebox, GA showed a more versatile, band-influenced side with songs like theStatus Quosampling \"Purple Haze,\" the rocky \"Madder,\" and fun-loving ska of \"But I Feel Good\".The Best of Groove Armadais a great selection of songs showing the diversity and musical progression of the band, a perfect introduction for the un-initiated and a good collection for those already converted. --Georgina Collins"}

{"description": "The dates and facts surrounding the birth of Carlos Gardel,  even his real name and nationality, are still argued about--more than  60 years after his death in a plane crash. But his place as the  greatest singer in the history of tango is indisputable. Gardel not  only nearly singlehandedly defined the tango-cancion (sung tango) and  set the standards of interpretation. For many, he embodied the very  spirit of tango--urbane yet streetwise, romantic but also tough,  sensual but oh-so-cool. This collection, smartly selected and  reasonably improved aurally, offers ample proof. North American  audiences may recognize songs such as El Dia Que Me Quieras (sung by  Luis Miguel, Julio Iglesias), Mi Buenos Aires Querido (Iglesias) and  Por Una Cabeza (soundtrackTrue Lies). Gardel brings to his  performance impeccable intonation, precise phrasing and just the right  pathos. These are the definitive versions by a master at the peak of  his powers.--Fernando Gonzalez", "title": "Best of"}

They, like many similar bands from Liverpool, signed with Brian Epstein in 1963 and ended up on the Parlophone label, with George Martin as record producer. With some John Lennon-Paul McCartney compositions, the Fourmost had some success, especially with John's 'Hello Little Girl'. Their biggest hit was 'A Little Lovin' (#6 in Britain in 1964). After that, though, the lack of a songwriter within the band kept the Fourmost from achieving the same popularity that others achieved during the late 1960s, and they soon stopped recording, instead touring on the cabaret circuit. This 32 track single CD features the two afore mentioned tracks plus lots more. EMI. 2005."}
{"description": "The great Cuban band Irakere has been  underrecognized  only because the United States' trade embargo on Cuba kept the  mainstream jazz audience unaware of  their existence until 1977.  Members of Cuba's reigning big band, the Orquesta Cubana de   M&eacute;sica Moderna, formed Irakere in 1971. The new group's  leaders were virtuosic  pianist Chucho Vald&eacute;s, trumpeter Arturo  Sandoval, and  saxophonist Paquito d'Rivera. After the '77  diplomatic thaw, the band played a U.S. tour and signed with  Columbia  records. The material here is from the Columbia period,  the  bulk of which was recorded live in New York in 1979. The   band's ability to play complex jazz arrangements with salsa   rhythms is a revelation.--John Swenson", "title": "Best of"}

{"title": "Best of", "description": "The Housemartins, in only a short space of time, became one of the premier pop acts of the mid '80s. Four years and two albums is not a lot to build a greatest hits collection from, but that's exactly what you get with The Best Of The Housemartins, and it's a testament to how good they were. Although they only released two albums, they created some of the quintessential singles from that period. 'Five Get Over Excited', 'Happy Hour', 'Caravan Of Love' and 'The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death' helped define the 80s as much as Thatcherism, neon socks & soda stream. The songs are catchy and easy to sing along to, but they are often accompanied by a message. The key members, Paul Heaton & Norman Cook, have gone on to even bigger success (Beautiful South/Fatboy Slim) but what this compilation proves is that their beginnings were equally as infectious as their present. 14 tracks in all.

{"description": "The New Jersey-based Latin metal sextet Ill Nino includes  members Cristian Machado (vocals), Dave Chavarri (drums), Marc Rizzo  (guitars), Jardel Paisante (guitars), Lazaro Pina (bass), and Roger Vasquez  (percussion). Most of its members are of South American descent, resulting  in a type of music that combines crunchy heavy metal with Latin rhythms and  lyrics that alternate between English and Spanish. The idea of Ill Nino  began when former Pro Pain member Chavarri was touring as an interim member  of Max Cavalerra's Soulfly. Once his tour of duty ended and he returned  home, he immediately phoned his friends Rizzo and Machado with the idea of  forming an original band (to quote Chavarri, \"The idea is to be as heavy as  possible and as melodic as possible &#xC2;&#x97; with a Latin twist\"), with the other  members enlisting shortly thereafter. The new group enjoyed exposure via  the New York metal college radio station WSOU and began to gig heavily,  opening for the likes of Kittie, Soulfly, Snapcase, plus a co-headlining  set at the March Metal Meltdown festival in New Jersey. Soon after, the  sextet signed to Roadrunner Records, issuing Ill Nino's debut recording,  Revolution/Revolucion in July of 2001. Two years touring to support the  record followed before the reappeared in the record stores with 2003's  Confession.

{"title": "Best of", "description": "The prototypical journeyman, Billy Swan had a fleeting moment in the spotlight: \"I Can Help,\" a good-natured throwaway Swan put together in a half-hour, became an out-of-the-blue country/pop crossover hit in 1974. While the jaunty rockabilly gem opens this 16-song survey of Swan's Columbia work, a low-key charm spans the album. Other standouts here include \"Lover Please\" (Swan composed the rock & roll staple in 1962 while still in high school;Clyde McPhattertook it to the charts) and \"Don't Be Cruel\" (slowed down and given an earnest reading). Following his short-lived moment in the sun, Swan returned to being a sideman for the likes ofKris KristoffersonandT-Bone Burnett, making him that rarest of performers: an artist keenly aware of his limitations. This collection proves, however, that he deserves to be more than a name that turns up in '70s trivia contests.--Steven Stolder"}

But the fact that a youngBob Dylanonce  claimed he was going to be more famous than they were--and then borrowed  the melody from their song \"The Patriot Game\" for his own \"With God on  our Side\"--hints at the level of influence they had. The tracks onThe Best of the Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makemwere made between 1962 and 1969, and include a  well-chosen selection of drinking songs, rebel ballads, and comic turns,  most of which were recorded live in various concerts. The quartet belts  out these songs with a good-natured gusto that owes more to the Weavers  than it does to traditional Irish performance technique, but their  renditions of classics like \"The Rising of the Moon\" and \"A Nation Once  Again\" are still stirring.

{"description": "Warrant is a schizophrenic band, a condition illustrated by this 16-song \"hits\" collection. The Los Angeles-based lineup's 1989 debut,Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich, featured such metal-lite delights as \"32 Pennies,\" the title track, the insipid, self-referential trademark hit \"Down Boys,\" the sappy power ballad \"Heaven,\" the lascivious \"Cherry Pie,\" and \"Sometimes She Cries,\" all of which appear on this best-of. But by 1992'sDog Eat Dog, Warrant had gone heavier and grungier, befitting the musical climate of the era. Consequently, the quintet lost fans who perceived the group as bandwagon jumpers; actually, they do a decent job with heavier songs such as \"Machine Gun\" and \"Hole in My Wall.\" Proving that singer Jani Lane and pals could be tender and memorable without being cheesy are the gutsy, bluesy \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" and the beautiful \"I Saw Red.\" Their cover ofQueen's \"We Will Rock You,\" on the other hand, almost manages to sap the song's inherent monster groove. While Warrant's move from image-conscious pop-metal to a heavier sound was awkward in execution, fans of either of the band's phases--and those who like both--will dig this diverse disc.--Katherine Turman", "title": "Best of"}

{"description": "Al Barr - Lead Vocals  Ken Casey - Lead Vocals, Bass  Matt Kelly - Drums, Bodhran, Vocals  James Lynch - Guitar, Vocals  Marc Orrell - Guitar, Accordion, Vocals  Ryan Foltz - Mandolin, Tin Whistle, Dulcimer  Scruffy Wallace - BagpipesThe Dropkick Murphys&#x92; uncompromising spirit and matchless energy surge through Blackout, the Boston-based, Celtic punk outfit&#x92;s triumphant new album. From the urgent and irresistible opener \"Walk Away\" &#x96; which takes to task a father who abandons his family &#x96; to the superb, bagpipe-doused blue collar homage \"Worker&#x92;s Song,\" DKM continues to build off of the musical blueprint it began with back in 1996.Perhaps the hard charging, chant-along \"Gonna Be A Blackout Tonight\" best represents just how far the Dropkick Murphys have come. When approached a year ago by Woody Guthrie&#x92;s daughter Nora with the prospect of putting some of her legendary father&#x92;s unpublished lyrics to music, the net result was the fiery punk firecracker that became the title track to DKM&#x92;s fourth studio set.Rooted in the sounds of The Clash, The Pogues, AC/DC and Stiff Little Fingers, the Murphys started with humble but enthusiastic means, self-releasing early recordings and touring to support them. Just two years later, the band's hard work aligned them with Hellcat Records, Tim Armstrong's new imprint for Brett Gurewitz&#x92;s Epitaph label. The resulting Do or Die, produced by Armstrong's Rancid-mate Lars Fredriksen, lit the musical fuse that would soon explode inside the punk community. Chronicling DKM's innovative fusion of blistering rock & roll, melodic Irish folk, and a deep loyalty to the working class, Do or Die rendered sales of 150,000 largely due to word of mouth in the underground and forged a path in punk rock that turned a whole new generation of kids onto Celtic & traditional folk music although in this case with a much bigger kick in the ass!Introducing the vocal exchanges of Al Barr and Ken Casey  2001's ambitious Sing Loud Sing Proud incorporated more instrumentation than any previous effort. Defining the Murphys' position as leaders of a new sub-genre that could only be concocted in the heart of Boston, the disc's hometown anthems and whiskey-soaked melodies earned the group even wider acclaim. Continuously surprising industry pundits by outdrawing even high profile mainstream acts as headliners on major tours and festival participants on four continents, DKM landed high-profile slots on the Warped and Punk-O-Rama tours, plus achieving personal goals by performing at the Sex Pistol's infamous Silver Jubilee gig and on the Boston born Conan O'Brien Show in the wake of Sing Loud.The Dropkick Murphys incendiary live performances were the subject of their next release, 2002&#x92;s Live On St. Patrick&#x92;s Day From Boston, MA. An exhibition of the group&#x92;s infamous, annual homecoming gigs, these events find ale swilling hooligans standing alongside punk rock supporters of all ages. The concerts have become so popular, in fact, that 2003 saw the Murphys move an unprecedented 8,000 tickets for four shows, shattering the venue sales record previously held by the legendary Ramones.With Blackout, the Dropkick Murphys deliver their finest record to date. No mere \"punk rock\" album, its lack of pretension and honesty puts it much closer to the works of Bragg and even Springsteen. As impressively innovative and broad in musical scope as ever, Blackout finds DKM&#x92;s persevering spirit and heartfelt approach to music omni-potent.", "title": "Blackout"}
{"title": "Blackout", "description": "Fear and looting in New York. That's how many remember the 1977 blackout. While Son of Sam was still at large and unemployment was high, nine million people were suddenly plunged into darkness on a hot July evening. Unlike the comparative calm that characterized the 1965 and 2003 blackouts, in 1977 mobs went on a violent rampage. Adults, teens and children torched buildings, yanked protective metal grills off storefronts and smashed windows to fill their shopping carts with food, appliances, jewelry and clothing. These groups outnumbered police (only 14 officers were on duty in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that evening) and robbed more than 2,000 stores city-wide. By the time power was restored after 25 hours, damages from the devastation had climbed toward $61 million. Rutgers history professor Goodman, a Pulitzer finalist for his first book (Stories of Scottsboro), carries the reader beyond conventional journalism for a multidimensional, kaleidoscopic narrative history, covering the events and aftermath from all angles: \"I tell my story in bursts, recreating incidents, deeds, accidents, encounters, conversations, exchanges, and arguments, trying to evoke mood and place and time.\" He recalls the 1977 blackout through personal accounts, studies, public reports and period articles from magazines (Time, Newsweek) and newspapers (the New York Times, Daily News, New York Post, Village Voice, Amsterdam News). While the more mundane tales of revelry and inconvenience will appear familiar to many readers after blackouts this past year in the U.S., Canada, England and Italy, Goodman reminds us that the excessive looting of 1977 is the looming dark side of power outages in the electrified world.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

The album became the group's first platinum disc in the U.S., and the dynamic single &quot;No One Like You&quot; became a staple of album rock radio. While the Scorpions had created powerful anthems and epic rockers in the past,Blackoutmixed the ingredients just right. The title track was an endorphin rush of fast-riffing guitars and electrified, high-pitched vocals that culminated with the sound of shattering glass. &quot;Can't Live Without You&quot; was a powerful melange of flash, firepower, and pure melody, and the slow, surging &quot;China White&quot; sounded like a psychedelic interpretation of Led Zeppelin's &quot;Kashmir.&quot; After years of ignored visas, Scorpions had finally arrived in America.--Jon Wiederhorn"}

{"title": "Blackout", "description": "Superpower-laden high-school students tangle with terrorists in Wells&#x2019; YA sci-fi dystopian novel as it marches along a somewhat shaky route, with a boilerplate plot that borrows from Heroes and X-Men. Teenager Aubrey has managed to survive an alcoholic father and poverty, but that all changes when she discovers the power to literally vanish. Her classmate Jack has had to take a menial job that estranges him from his friends. When a militia force rolls into prom and rounds up the bewildered kids, it turns out they are seeking Lambdas, or teenagers infected with a virus that somehow causes them to develop superpowers. Aubrey and Jack get sent to a detention camp and eventually meet determined terrorists Alec and Laura. For the teens, discovering the bigger picture means leaving behind childhood and deciding which side is the right one to be on. While the characters are oddly flat and lack emotional connection, the small-town Utah setting frames this as an every-person story. The promise of a series and a huge cliff-hanger ending should entice some readers to follow the characters and events. Grades 8-11. --Julie Trevelyan"}

Elsewhere pop, soul, reggae, and folk slip into the mix, making the band's histrionic outbursts all the more effective. Jahred's lyrics, too, are above the norm, if a bit too self-focused.--Dominic Wills"}

As Eileen handles a measles outbreak during the children's evacuation and Polly struggles to work as a London shopgirl, hints of trouble with the time-travel equipment barely register on their radar.

{"title": "Blue", "description": "Nearly 35 years after being tagged for debasing Billie Holiday's legacy with her slick pop vocals in the biopicLady Sings the Blues--an approach producer Berry Gordy claims he had her take to make her \"more relatable to a general audience\"--Diana Ross gets a chance to redeem herself with these jazzier, alternate versions of the same material. Recorded around the time of the 1972 film (several bonus tracks come directly from the movie sessions), the original album was conceived as a companion piece to the soundtrack. But it was shelved and, we are told, lost in the vaults until recently. The good news is that when she commits herself to jazz, with a group of top jazz musicians behind her (playing arrangements by Benny Golson and Oliver Nelson), Ross holds her own. Her renditions of Holiday staples such as \"You've Changed\" and \"Easy Living\" are a bit mild, but lovely and relaxed. She makes up for the basic thinness of her voice with her cool, immaculate handling of melody. It's when she relies on her pop-soul instincts, as she does on a painfully awkward reading of \"I Loves You Porgy,\" or has to contend with album arranger Gil Askey's Vegas-style touches, that she sounds unconvincing or unsteady. But Ross' diehard fans won't want to be without \"Blue\" and her more casual admirers will be intrigued by this departure.--Lloyd Sachs"}

{"description": "Depending on your point of view,Christmasis either a quaint sonic time capsule extracted from the mid-1980s or a timeless holiday classic. The first in what has become an ongoing series of Mannheim Steamroller Christmas recordings, this CD has sold millions, which seems to indicate that it is everything its advertising claims it to be: \"America's favorite Christmas music.\" The powerfully successful Mannheim Steamroller formula, conceived by group mastermind Chip Davis, involves a blend of Renaissance-flavored moods and instrumentation (strings, harpsichord, flute, French horn) intertwined with polite pop instrumental music. At times, the analog synthesizers used in this 1984 recording sound dated and a little cheesy, particularly on \"Deck the Halls\" and \"Good King Wenceslas.\" But it is a forgivable offense since live instruments and the earnest but ersatz medieval atmosphere they evoke dominate 8 of the 11 tracks. As pleasant and soothing as a Willard Scott birthday wish,Christmasdoes offer one selection that truly merits \"classic\" status: the reverent, prayerful, slow-motion interpretation of \"Silent Night\" (\"Stille Nacht\") for piano and strings that closes the album--a beautiful and heart-touching work.

{"title": "Christmas", "description": "We suggest that few bands from an ostensibly \"indie rock\" background should release Christmas music, if not out of respect for the holiday or material then at least out of a sense of self-esteem. Low, however, were made for this. Their attention to musical detail combined with the heavenly vocal harmonies of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker are perfectly attuned to both traditional carols like 'Silent Night' and more contemporary tunes such as 'Blue Christmas'. Now this is a recording you can pull out  to pre-empt another dose of Bing Crosby or Englebert Humperdink. Christmas contains a selection of seasonal songs, including four originals by the band, mostly recorded at Low's 20&#xA7; Below studio in Duluth, MN.  'If You Were Born Today' and 'Blue Christmas' were released as a 7 inch single in 1997 on the English Wurlitzer Jukebox label, while 'Taking Down The Tree' is taken from a 1998 compilation of live recordings issue by the Dutch VPRO radio station."}

{"title": "Christmas Album", "description": "Herbert Khaury, a.k.a. Tiny Tim, was by all accounts a lonely, romantic child who spent much of his youth trying to escape into a fantasy land of old 78 rpm records. He learned how to play the ukulele in 1954 from an Arthur Godfrey songbook and began toting his instrument to a series of musical auditions, using a paper sack as his instrument case. One audition in 1967 got him on TV'sLaugh-In, and he had a meteoric rise and matching fall by the early '70s.  He never gave up, though, and tried recording a handful of albums in hopes of a comeback. Recorded in Sydney, Australia, back in 1993, this CD features Tiny Tim performing a dozen Christmas tunes, including \"Silent Night\" and \"O Come All Ye Faithful.\" An overproduced and mediocre rock band largely covers up his vocals and ukulele playing. Tim's strength was always his love and appreciation of old 1920s pop tunes, none of which are present here. He had an admittedly loony approach to his performances, but often his sincerity and connection to his material gave the tunes a charm and strength not present on this Christmas assortment. If you're looking for a silly Christmas novelty album, this might work--for the right occasion and with enough eggnog. If not, try some of his better efforts, such asGirl, on which he's backed up byBrave Combo.--Terry Zwigoff"}

{"description": "It may seem weird to call a seasonal album \"essential,\" but along with Phil Spector'sChristmas Gift for You, this is arguably the finest rock & roll Christmas album of all time. Recorded in 1957 at the height of his artistry--when he truly could be called the King of Rock & Roll--this album demonstrates Presley having a lot of vocal fun with a variety of styles, whether it's a carol (\"Silent Night\") or pop standard (Gene Autry's \"Here Comes Santa Claus\"). He does one of the greatest versions of \"White Christmas\" ever recorded, basically using theDrifters' version as a blueprint--and then singing all the parts himself. His \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" is definitive--but the best moments are the \"new\" tracks written specifically for this release, including the classic \"Blue Christmas,\" Lieber & Stoller's \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\" (one of the most sexually suggestive holiday tunes ever), and the wonderful, pop-based \"Santa, Bring My Baby Back to Me.\" All these tracks are available on theKing of Rock 'n' Rollbox set--but if you don't own that, this belongs under any Christmas tree--though Elvis fans have been known to listen to tracks from this in the middle of July!--Bill Holdship", "title": "Christmas Album"}
{"description": "Johnny Mathis is one of the few classic artists whose names have become synonymous with the holidays. He practically owns \"Marshmallow World,\" for instance. The silky smooth crooner has released at least one new Christmas album every decade since his '50s hit-making heyday. His first entry of the 2000s may not be the best choice for the uninitiated, but anyone who's loved his Christmas music in the past surely won't be disappointed. Mathis's voice has matured, but that tenor is still beautiful, as he delivers his usual mix of carols and pop standards. Like so many other Christmas artists, Mathis is at his best when he's covering the already familiar: \"Frosty the Snowman\" and \"Have a Holly Jolly Christmas\" pop like Sinatra here, making up for the rather unmemorable \"Heavenly Peace.\" That voice, though, has always been an instrument of romance and fantasy, two elements that blend perfectly with the holiday spirit.--Bill Holdship", "title": "Christmas Album"}

{"description": "This mix-and-match compilation of mostly solo piano material from David Lanz is a modest but pleasant package, a commercially minded collection of older material assembled by Lanz's former record label without his input. Those who favor Lanz's gentle, overtly romantic, glissando-heavy style should enjoy this 12-track disc as it delivers a reliably quiet audio backdrop that ranges somewhere between reverential and sentimental. In addition to tracks lifted from existing recordings (Lanz's sugaryBeloved, his attractiveChristmas Eve, and contributions he made to past Narada holiday compilations), this disc includes three selections from a 1989 concert performance. Two of those pieces, the solo \"What Child Is This?\" and the ensemble-based \"It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\" (with a radiant contribution on oboe byNancy Rumbel), are the album's standouts.--Terry Wood", "title": "Christmas Album"}

{"description": "An elaborately detailed Venetian venue serves as backdrop for this rarefied retelling of the traditional fairy tale. Ella's mother is still alive as the story opens, the wife of a wealthy sea merchant who rarely sees his family. When, from afar, Ella falls in love with lonely-looking Duke Fidelio, she confides in her mother, wondering sadly \"if his father is as busy as mine.\" Her mother dies and Ella is sent off to \"boarding school,\" from whence she is summoned to become housekeeper for her father's new bride and her daughters. Despite such plot enhancements, the distinguishing element here is Delamare's ( The Christmas Secret ) arresting artwork. His paintings feature sharply defined images carefully juxtaposed so as to resemble collage. Ornately dressed and elegantly coiffed figures traipse about in palatial splendor, suffused in an amber wash. Ella's Julia Roberts-like sultriness contrasts starkly, perhaps awkwardly, with Delamare's oddly planed courtiers. Slightly skewed proportions, ominous perspectives and hallucinatory settings (Ella rides a fish-shaped gondola with a pumpkin-shaped cabin) impart a vaguely menacing quality to the work. Best suited to diehard Cinderella devotees and fans of Delamare's highly stylized art. Ages 4-8.Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Cinderella"}

The storytelling is straightforward and the plot follows the traditional pattern, with Cinderella attending three balls before the climax. However, Eilenberg interjects his own asides. For example, after the stepsisters purchase expensive outfits for the event, he slyly notes, \"They thought they looked beautiful! (In fact, they looked frightful.)\" More humor can be found in the eccentric oil illustrations. The two oddly shaped stepsisters cramming their toes into the tiny slipper provide great comic relief.

Even as the heroine tends the fire, readers will see her beauty.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Cinderella", "description": "This elegant retelling of the beloved fairy tale follows the story line that Perrault introduced and Disney made so familiar. The gentle text streamlines the story, beginning and ending appropriately with &#x201C;Once upon a time&#x201D; and &#x201C;happily ever after.&#x201D; The fairy godmother appears on cue, applies her magic touch with specific instructions, and then disappears. The prince is rightfully smitten with Cinderella&#x2019;s &#x201C;gentle eyes and sweet smile.&#x201D; Other than the stepsisters being unable to dance at the wedding due to their sore feet, the story plays out as expected. The dreamlike illustrations and Cinderella&#x2019;s delicate, childlike face and undeveloped figure provide enough room for many little girls to slip inside. The details hint at Louis XIV&#x2019;s style and have the requisite storybook castle perched on a mountaintop at the end of a winding road. The compositions support the text beautifully, moving readers along in muted tones of mostly blues, greens, and Cinderella&#x2019;s brown dress. The closing scene is satisfying as the prince tenderly kisses Cinderella&#x2019;s cheek against a white background with a pink heart-shaped tree and white doves overhead.

{"title": "Closer", "description": "In chapters titled with the names of the characters on whom they focus, this brief novel links together a small, bleakly debauched cast of gay men. Dedicated to sex and violence for the catharsis these acts would seem to promise, the men settle into a dull grind of physical encounters that, no matter how searing, fail to provide transcendence. The fault of their miserable existence seems to lie not in them, but in existence itself; life by its very nature can offer little but a thrillingly painful prelude to death. The novel's problem is not Cooper's point of view but the monotony of his spare, honest treatment: his deadpan look at chronic sexual anomie is so faithful to the phenomenon it describes that the work succumbs, laconically, to weariness. Scope is further limited by Cooper's decision to address the condition of despair more than its cause. Though convincing, sometimes darkly funny evidence of dissolution and decay abounds (\" . . . men had worn him away. They'd fastened him to a treadmill that spun until there was nothing around but a vague outline, smeared in blood\"), memorable details tend to languish in dolorous prose.Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Closer", "description": "In retrospect, the second and final album by this Manchester postpunk band seems to point straight at singer Ian Curtis's suicide, which happened a few months before it was released. The band's reverberating mesh of minor-key lines and Curtis's tremorous bass voice are doomy enough on their own, and attention to the words reveals references to blacker-than-black stories by J.G. Ballard and Joseph Conrad; the void and its terrors were splitting Curtis apart from the inside. &quot;I put my trust in you,&quot; he sings, and his voice leaves no doubt that that trust has been betrayed. But the music, grim and powerful as it is, points to the direction the surviving members took as New Order, incorporating the mechanical gravity of club rhythms.--Douglas Wolk"}

{"description": "A neat comic sense, an unfeigned comfort with 19th-century manners and forms, and a good eye for English milieus made Betjeman (1906&ndash;1984) both a great craftsman of light verse and the most popular British poet of his day. His first U.K.Collected Poems, in 1958, sold millions of copies. Newly available in the United States alongside A.N. Wilson's new biography, this big book can show Americans what so many Britons cherish: ballads and love poems devoted to strapping, tennis-playing young women; a fondness for Cornwall's seaside; devotion to traditional England, along with an amused contempt for the middle-class ways that might destroy it (the ways in which he, and his readers, actually live). Betjeman and his sympathetic characters, from King Edward VIII to a \"husband down at the depot with car in car-park,\" hike along \"stony lanes and back at six to tea,\" celebrate Christmas, admire South London's churches and denounce the \"Inexpensive Progress\" which plans to \"Leave no village standing./ Which could provide a landing/ For aeroplanes to roar.\" Though Philip Larkin called Betjeman (poet laureate from 1972 on) his favorite contemporary poet, \"Betj\" provides nothing like Larkin's memorable depths; his enviable skill, however, might entice Anglophiles, or devotees of light verse, to queue up.(Dec.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Collected Poems", "description": "Born in Chicago in 1923, the late James Schuyler gravitated early on to Manhattan, where he came to be associated with such stalwarts of the New York School as Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, and John Ashbery. Yet his work--unlike, say, Ashbery's, with whom he wrote a novel,A Nest of Ninnies--is eminently accessible. Indeed, Schuyler'sCollected Poemsfunctions as an exquisite illustration of how to write poetry with a crystal-clear surface. And he always remains a master of the light touch, even when he himself is in desperate straits.In Schuyler's long pieces, such as \"Hymn to Life,\" \"The Morning of the Poem,\" and \"A Few Days,\" he casually reverses the romantic position: anti-didactic, anti-epiphanic, he trusts his imagination and resists any psychological theorizing about why one memory, one perception, is connected to another. He mistrusts monumentality. Wisdom, he knows, is enervating: \"Things should get better as you / grow older, but that / is not the way.

{"description": "Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950), winner in 1923 of the second annual Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, was a daring, versatile writer whose work includes plays, essays, short stories, songs, and the libretto to an opera that premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera House to rave reviews.Millay infused new life into traditional poetic forms, bringing new hope to a generation of youth disillusioned by the political and social upheaval of the First World War. She ventured fearlessly beyond familiar poetic subjects to tackle political injustice, social discrimination, and women's sexuality in her poems and prose. In the 1920s and '30s, Millay was considered a spokesperson for personal freedom in America, particularly for women, and we turn to her lines to illuminate the social history of the period and the Bohemian lifestyle she and her friends enjoyed.Yet Millay's poetry is still decisively modern in its message, and it continues to resonate with readers facing personal and moral issues that defy the test of time: romantic love, loss, betrayal, compassion for one another, social equality, patriotism, and the stewardship of the natural world.Collected Poemsfeatures Millay's incisive and impassioned lyric poetry and sonnets, many of which are considered among the finest in the language, as well as the poet's last volume,Mine the Harvest, compiled and published in 1956 by her sister Norma Millay.", "title": "Collected Poems"}

Reaching back to 1948 and including recent work, it highlights the significance of the formalist poetic legacy Justice has inherited, and which he will leave to future generations. His graceful, down-to-earth poetic voice gently calls our attention to the simplest of things--hands, a porch, a pair of shoes--with such poignancy of observation or association that one breathes an \"ah\" of surprise, followed by a feeling of recognition. Justice has a gift for understanding how subtlety and simplicity are effective means for touching readers on deep levels and for forming a bond of mutual discovery. With an underlying melancholy and simultaneous awareness of the impermanent nature of life, Justice does not resist or reject so much as mark passages--the departures that deposit us in new places or inspire us to notice what's left behind.Janet St. JohnCopyright &#169; American Library Association.

{"description": "Lauded at his death as a major American writer, a great poet of sociability and comedy, an important part of the gay literary tradition and a master of traditional forms, Merrill (1926-1995) is well-served by this monumental gathering off his shorter poems, carefully edited and likely to garner major attention and sales. McClatchy (Twenty Questions, etc.) is Merrill's literary executor, and Yenser the author of a Merrill monograph. They include Merrill's 11 trade volumes; poems from two small-press books, The Black Swan (1946) and The Yellow Pages (1974); 21 verse translations; and 45 poems retrieved from periodicals and manuscripts. Excluded are some juvenilia and light verse, as well as Merrill's book-length poem The Changing Light at Sandover, in print as a separate volume. Merrill's sonnets, sapphics, longer sequences and sinuous sentences encompass lyric pathos, ebullient comedy, rapt romance and acrid satire. Their formal sophistication can belie their depth of feeling, which is exactly what some readers love best about Merrill's work. New readers ought to skip the often-dry earliest books, begin with Merrill's 1960s works and read forward. Confirmed fans will no doubt flip to the end of the book, where they will encounter many poems for the first time--most are short and witty, many of them are fine. The poems from Merrill's last year can be arresting, including a self-elegy in which the dying poet thinks of himself as a Christmas tree. (Mar.) Forecast: Huge, career-summing reviews of this book are already in production at various typewriters and computers along the eastern seaboard. The story of Merrill's personal fortune has always made good copy, and revelations of the poet's death by AIDS in Alison Lurie's Familiar Spirits: A Memoir of James Merrill and David Jackson (Viking), also due in March, should bring less-than-regular readers of poetry to the book via respectful items in glossies. Libraries of all stripes will also certainly acquire the book, which could show up on some bestseller lists.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Collected Poems"}

{"title": "Collected Poems", "description": "Major poets, like trick-or-treaters, tend to arrive in pairs or small groups (whether this is a matter of fate or academic convenience may be debated). And yet from roughly 1930 to 1950, British and Irish poetry seemed to fall under the sway of a single writer: W. H. Auden. Auden was hardly a solitary figure, of course his compatriots included Louis MacNeice, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis (father of Daniel), and the four writers were once thought to be so intimately related that the poet Roy Campbell referred to them as MacSpaunday. But it wasn t a relationship of equals: the MacSpaunday poets were usually considered notable not because of how closely they resembled one another, but because of how much the other three looked like Auden.That has begun to change for Louis MacNeice, whose reputation has been steadily rising for 20 years in Britain and Ireland, in part because of vigorous support from Irish writers like Edna Longley, Paul Muldoon and Derek Mahon. MacNeice s Collected Poems has finally been published in the United States, where readers will now have a chance to approach this under&#xAD;estimated writer on his own terms....He is one of the 20th century s great poets of loneliness. And yet this aspect of MacNeice can be easy to overlook, in part because he seems (as is frequently said of Auden) entirely comfortable with the rhythms and clutter of the modern world: Cubical scent-bottles artificial legs arctic foxes and electric mops. We think of solitary poets as writing about ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas; we don t usually think of them as being interested in electric mops.Nor do we think of them as being fluent. Yet MacNeice is effortlessly, almost ridiculously articulate he seems capable (again like Auden) of writing about nearly anything, and in nearly any form. The 800 or so pages here include tiny poems (the nine-line Upon This Beach ); book-length poems ( Autumn Journal, which helped make his reputation); book-length poems in terza rima ( Autumn Sequel, which nearly undid it); virtuoso deployment of nearly all forms of rhyme ( London Rain rhymes a word with itself in every stanza); and a vocabulary that suavely extends from Tom or Dick or Harry and trams to ochred and &#xAD; archaize. Surely a poet of loneliness should do a little more stammering.Or should he? The difference between loneliness and mere solitariness, after all, is that the lonely sensibility wants to be otherwise. There is a reaching out that never quite touches. In MacNeice s best work, the ingeniousness and inevitable failure of that reaching indicates the depth of the longing. He is a superb love poet, for instance, yet his love poems often foreground their own ephemerality, like ice sculptures in the summertime. Consider Meeting Point, which is about the fiction writer Eleanor Clark, one of MacNeice s many, many paramours. ...What we most want, MacNeice suggests, is simply to know each other better, but that possibility depends on laboring blindly through darkness. With the publication of Collected Poems, MacNeice s own excavation is now complete; readers who meet him halfway will find a passage that opens and opens and opens. --New York Times Book Review"}
{"title": "Collected Poems", "description": "Milosz's stature as a poet is confirmed and enhanced by this massive volume, which brings together new translations, new poems and generous selections from previous verse collections. In the dark, symbolic lyrics of the 1930s, and in his cry of agony through the Nazi years, the Polish-born Nobel laureate snatches shards of hope from the desolate wasteland called Western civilization. His satiric postwar commentaries cut through Cold War hypocrisy as he contemplates life in Poland and in the U.S., where he emigrated. The redeeming power of love, the fleetingness of time are refracted through the tragedy of the 20th century in verses poised on the abyss. In the sweet, aching music of his philosophical poems from the California years, Milosz embraces a world he still loves but cannot fully grasp. Poems written during 1985-87, elegaic and celebratory, stare calmly at death. This immensely rewarding volume spans the full measure of a remarkable poetic achievement.Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}

As esteemed critic and biographer Arnold Rampersad (Ralph Ellison, 2007) writes in his afterword, Hayden gravitated to books as a poor foster child in Detroit, hampered by and bullied for his severe myopia. Initially inspired by Countee Cullen, he studied with Auden, and those two mentors represent the primary forces in Hayden&#x2019;s work: his profound soundings of African American history, his passion for the English language, and what Rampersad describes as his &#x201C;transracial philosophy.&#x201D; Hayden addresses slavery with ringing empathy and protest in &#x201C;Middle Passage&#x201D; and &#x201C;Runagate, Runagate,&#x201D; examines black stereotypes with poignant sharpness in &#x201C;Aunt Jemima of the Ocean Waves,&#x201D; and pays tribute to Malcolm X.

{"title": "Collected Poems", "description": "Showcasing a poetic career spanning 65 years, this fine volume demonstrates the strength of Boyle's ( This Is Not a Letter and Other Poems ) commitment to a political aesthetic, one that combines a wealth of nuanced knowledge with a genuine liberal spirit. Boyle adopts a number of different voices, often vernacular, setting off opposing viewpoints to fully convey the scope of her themes. Although always attuned to the myriad beauty of existence, the poet never loses sight of the plight of the disenfranchised and the oppressed. Among Boyle's causes are homosexuality (\"I speak of it as a thing with a future\"), homelessness (\"old hags cast up against the wainscoting of Grand Central's ladies' room\"), and anti-Semitism (to make a point, she declares, \"I have had enough of the Jews, more than enough\"). She also pays loving tribute to writers and friends who have influenced her along the way, William Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore among them. Boyle adopts a pretentiously baroque style at times, but more often, she prefers to explore colloquial American speech in all of its variety.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

A teen runaway from Newark who struggled with heroin during the 1970s, Hull tried to mix the late-Romantic fire of Hart Crane, realist detail and the seductiveness of jazz. Hull painted her natal city as \"just one big hockshop\" with its grilled storefronts amid \"intangible empires of fear and regret, sudden/ crests of tenderness,\" while a tribute to doomed trumpeter Chet Baker asked, \"Why court the brink &amp; then step back?\" Hull's earlier verse examines her parents' troubled lives and their East European immigrant heritage; later, wilder, better poems confront her own rough past, a \"dizzy trip through the ripped underside of things.\" The seven-part \"Suite for Emily\" remembers a girl Hull knew, now dead from AIDS, on Newark's \"carnivorous streets,\" contrasting the friend of her youth to Emily Dickinson; a Prague verse travelogue offers praise \"for/ everything damned, for everything human &amp; lovely.\" Hull may not have discovered a whole new style, but her passion, and her power to depict emotional extremes, justifies the high regard in which she is held.(Nov.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Collected Poems", "description": "Starred Review.Despite (or because of) sectarian violence, Belfast in the late '60s and '70s produced a brace of extraordinary poetic talents. Among them, Seamus Heaney and Paul Muldoon moved to America and achieved international stardom, while Longley remained in Northern Ireland, developing a subtle power of his own, as this first retrospective since 1985 shows. Longley's debut volume,No Continuing City(1969), made clear his careful mastery of form, but not untilMan Lying on a Wall(1976) did he establish his recognizable style: Longley's short, segmented poems and sinuous lines, often approximating Latin hexameters, exhibit an understated beauty, and yet remain conscious of violence past and present, from the Trojan War through WWI and Northern Ireland's Troubles. An archetypal elegy depicts \"shell cases from the last war filled with flowers.\" War&mdash;what it does to combatants and to their children&mdash;becomes a preoccupation throughout Longley's work, especially in the hauntedGorse Fires(1991) and the mellifluousSnow Water(2004). Yet marital love and tenderness, domestic calm and pastoral counterpoise also stand among Longley's signature subjects: \"the fireflies at the waterfall, a well of stars.\" Longley's genius is pastoral and commemorative, summed up perhaps in this recent one-line poem: \"my lost lamb lovelier than all the wool.\"(Mar.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Collected Poems", "description": "The main details of Hughes's life are well-known: after his National Service with the RAF, the dashing poet marries the brilliant American Sylvia Plath in 1954, and becomes an instant celebrity with the publication of Hawk in the Rain in 1957. While \"The Thought-Fox\" scampers its way into numberless anthologies, he publishes the poems of Lupercal (1960) and Wodwo (1967), where he treats his own voice as a force of nature, threaded through a violent animism. His wife and his lover die by suicide. He makes a major artistic breakthrough with the widely praised sequence Crow (1971), which draws on his deep knowledge of English folklore, and sacrifices, for a kind of Zarathustrian bluntness, all lingering traces of formalism (though blank verse and ballad would continue to be favored methods). He writes plays and several children's books, and becomes poet laureate in 1984, publishing a surprisingly good book of civic verse, Rain Charm for the Duchy, in 1992. His final volume, Birthday Letters, is a conflicted, front-page-news-making account of his relationship with Plath. This enormous, rewarding compendium contains all of the above as well as numerous poems that were previously uncollected (such as the lovely, Williams-y miniature \"Snail\" and the long \"Scapegoat and Rabies,\" an indictment of the soldier culture that partly shaped Hughes); the entirety of his acclaimed Tales from Ovid; Hughes's appendices to the books as originally published; and copious bibliographic notes. Hughes is already canonical in Great Britain, and this volume, with its resolutely undomesticated bestiary, will mark out permanent space on the shelves of U.S. readers.Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

A few young musicians were brave enough to use it for something other than constructing a new set of clich&#xE9;s, including Newcastle's Paddy McAloon and his band, Prefab Sprout, who became cult faves in the bargain. This generous double-CD set offers up a well-balanced chronicle of McAloon and company's endearingly quirky, ever-literate pop concoctions, dividing its discs between the band's singles (including the privately pressed debut \"Lions in My Own Garden\") and cuts from a decade's worth of iconoclastic albums. Freely using a delightfully unpredictable palette that included jazz (especially the spare, gorgeous \"Couldn't Bear to Be Special\"), cabaret, neo-skiffle (\"Faron Young\"), lounge, and even Broadway--sometimes all in the space of three minutes--Prefab Sprout might well have anticipated much of what became the alt-rock clich&#xE9;s of the '90s, though delivered with a sense of genuine wit and virtually no overweening irony.The Collectionis a great way to (re)discover one of the great hidden musical treasures of the '80s.--Jerry McCulley"}

The shirt is made of a lightweight, durable nylon fabric that dries fast should you get splashed. The mesh-lined cape vents at the back shoulder, meanwhile, enhance the airflow, helping keep you cool in the hottest conditions. Finally, the shirt offers built-in Omni-Shade UV protection that keeps the sun off your back until you're ready to come inside. Also outfitted with two big chest pockets that offer plenty of room for small gear, the Bahama II is available in several sizes and colors.The Bahama II short-sleeve shirt includes mesh-lined cape vents at the shoulder to enhance the airflow.About Omni-Shade TechnologyColumbia's Omni-Shade clothing protects you from damaging UV radiation by blocking the majority of the sun's harmful rays, letting you stay out longer on sunny days. Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor)--which is a measure of sunburn reduction from sunblock and protects you from UVA rays--Columbia's Omni-Shade products are far more versatile, combining a tight-weave construction, UV reflectors, and UV absorbing technology. These features not only prevent sunburns and long-term skin damage, but they also protect the wearer from UVB rays in addition to UVA rays.

Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as \"Mother Boyle\" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry.

Columbia's Omni-Shade clothing protects you from damaging UV radiation by blocking the majority of the sun's harmful rays, letting you stay out longer on sunny days. Unlike SPF (Sun Protection Factor)--which is a measure of sunburn reduction from sunblock and protects you from UVA rays--Columbia's Omni-Shade products are far more versatile, combining a tight-weave construction, UV reflectors, and UV absorbing technology. These features not only prevent sunburns and long-term skin damage, but they also protect the wearer from UVB rays in addition to UVA rays. UVB rays are much more harmful than UVA, and are present even on cloudy days. Plus, Omni-Shade doesn't wear off. Instead, your safety increases as the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) increases. Several layers of Omni-Shade protection are available: UPF 15, UPF 30, UPF 40, and UPF 50-plus. It's like sunscreen, but you don't have to reapply. All Omni-Shade fabric carries the Skin Cancer Foundation's Seal of Recommendation, which is given to sun-protective fabrics that have a minimum UPF of 30.Omni-Dry is the ultimate moisture-management technology for the outdoors. Its superior wicking properties move moisture away from the body and helps sweat evaporate. During physical activity, increased body temperature causes perspiration. Normally this results in damp, clammy, and uncomfortable (not to mention unattractive) clothing. With Omni-Dry clothing, however, moisture is quickly wicked up into the fabric and away from the wearer's skin. The moisture then spreads out across the surface of the fabric and quickly evaporates. This wicking/evaporation process keeps you cool and the clothing dry. This not only helps regulate your temperature, but it also prevents chafing and keeps you comfortable all day.Features:Construction: 100-percent polyesterOmni-Dry advanced evaporationOmni-Shade sun protection, UPF 40Mechanical stretchRod holderButton down collarImportedAbout Columbia SportswearFounded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of skiwear in the United States.

Coming Home brings both vision and scholarship, rigor and imagination, to this all-important task of historical self-reflection, allowing us to glimpse profound overarching patterns that make newly intelligible not only our history but the specific challenges of our Planetary Era. With its publication, Coming Home immediately becomes necessary reading for our time -- necessary, at least, for those in our precarious civilization who know it is their peculiar calling to try to grasp the big picture as accurately as possible.' -- Richard Tarnas, author of The Passion of the Western Mind and Cosmos and Psyche 'For those travelers seeking meaning in this crisis-riven time, here is both map and provisions for the journey. This is a work of rare distinction. I bow to Kelly's respect for the radical uncertainty facing us now. His work illumines not only the inescapable nature of this uncertainty, but also its capacity to awaken and ennoble us at this turning in our human journey.' -- Joanna Macy, author, World as Lover, World as Self 'Kelly sketches an impossibly -- but all the more possibly -- Great Vision. It is not concocted of new agey spiritual pontification. It unfolds in dazzling breadth and trusty erudition, laced by a wise and earthy uncertainty.' -- Catherine Keller, Professor of Constructive Theology, Drew University; author of Face of the Deep: On the Mystery and On the Mystery: Discerning Divinity in Process 'Sean Kelly takes as his call the entire sweep of Western thought. He brings order to its profusion and finds major meanings and directions overlooked in traditional histories of ideas, all the while highlighting fascinating and forgotten clues and revealing undertows whose significance is becoming increasingly relevant and urgent in our own time. There may be other ways of ordering this vast field, but the story that Kelly presents is elegant, economical, immensely insightful, and, above all, charged with hopeful possibilities for change.' -- Freya Mathews, Associate Professor of Ecological Philosophy at La Trobe University 'Many readers will be familiar with the work of Richard Tarnas, who endorses this book by saying that it is necessary reading for our time, an assessment with which I wholeheartedly agree.' -- David Lorimer, Scientific and Medical Network Review, Winter 2010.", "title": "Coming Home"}

Unlike virtually every other high-profile R&amp;B record to arrive in recent years,Coming Homeresists the temptation to lean back, even a little, on its dazzled-up list of collaborators, Jermaine Dupri, Raphael Saadiq, and Dallas Austin among them. Hot beats abound, especially on the dancefloor-ready \"Up All Night,\" first single \"I Call it Love,\" and \"Why,\" but the overall vibe is pure Lionel, from the Commodores-esque \"What You Are\" to the \"Penny Lover\"-like prettiness of \"Coming Home,\" to the wavy steel-guitar-laced lament that is \"Outta My Head.\" Here are hooks that sink in instantly and vocals that float as if grafted to a bar of Ivory soap. Here, too, is a record unafraid of reaching artistically; if 2004'sJust For Youwas dominated by classy but predictable ballads,Coming Homerepresents Mr. Richie as the trailblazing musical titan generations of fans fell in love by.

{"title": "Coming Home", "description": "Lonestar lead singer Richie McDonald is the Conway Twitty of his generation. He knows what women want--as lovers, wives, and mothers. And since he's also the band's principal songwriter, he means to give it to them. That--and the major success of 1999's \"Amazed\"--is how Lonestar became the sappiest band in country-pop, building a repertoire of over-the-top ballads filled with romantic fantasies (the slowhand husband who takes his time making love, the devoted father who wilts at the sight of a sippy cup), all shot straight to the heart on the arrow of McDonald's emotional tenor. ThoughComing Home, the group's eighth album, features a new producer (Justin Niebank), the formula hasn't really changed. \"I Am a Man,\" \"I'll Die Tryin',\" \"I Never Needed You,\" and \"I Just Want to Love You\" all trade in fevered desire of one sort or another, even if Sara Evans couldn't possibly sound more disinterested in McDonald on \"I Never Needed You.\" But Niebank also tries to break it up a bit, although he doesn't push the band to get particularly original, or take the tempo out of the mid-zone. \"You're Like Comin' Home\" is really less about finding refuge in a woman's arms than about capturing Keith Urban's catchy and sophisticated brand of ear candy, while \"What's Wrong With That,\" another declaration of fatherly bliss, sounds suspiciously like a rewrite of Tim McGraw's \"Something Like That.\"  \"Little Town\" and \"Two Bottles of Beer\" mine two current songwriting stereotypes--the virtues of small-town America, and the tiresome Jimmy Buffett fixation. \"Wild,\" a contrived song about a curvaceous babe who saves it all for her man, feeds into typical male fantasies, not female. And \"When I Go Home Again\" gets down with the hoedown sound, just to remind you that this is supposed to be country music. Lonestar will never be raw and unvarnished in the style of so many other singer-songwriters from Texas. But what's missing is a song that dares to not play it safe, or even one that sounds as if it hadn't been written by committee. If Lonestar ever wants to bring things back to reality, the follow up toComing Homewill beMoving Out. Remember when hillbillies sang the blues?--Alanna Nash"}

{"description": "Many try, but few artists create music so rife with imagery that you are transported to an entirely fresh geographical plane. No one tours the Southwest like Nicholas Gunn, the flute/synth whiz whose The Music of the Grand Canyon was the most compelling tribute to the park in recent years. With this release, he finds himself at a new Crossroads, which for all intents and purposes is best described as the rocky but clear-skied region around the Four Corners. His latest spiritual excursion again draws on Native American history to build percussive red rock themes around crisp Southwestern architecture that can withstand both intense sunlight and heavy thunderstorms. Gunn's flute is always at the forefront, played either like a percussion instrument or a launching point for soaring orchestral ideas. Loping along the mountain roads and helping pay tribute to his always enthralling landscapes are the subtle energies of violinist Karen Briggs, cellist Sachi McHenry, and acoustic guitarists Zavier and Bill Shafton. ~ Jonathan Widran, All Music Guide", "title": "Crossroads"}

But John Lee Hooker recorded in a great many more styles than that over a career that stretched across more than half a century.  Those who'd learned from John Lee Hooker and appreciated his music's basic truths joined him with love and sensitivity on his last, best-selling records.  The career that had begun at Detroit house rent parties ended fifty years later with platinum records and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Unlike so many bluesmen of old, John Lee Hooker died with wealth and acclaim in equal measure.  It's something I can't figure out,  he said in Europe in 1964, but I'm just trying toreach out to all kinds of publics.

{"description": "His songs are among the most familiar in country music, yet he hasn't even recorded some of them. He counts bluegrass pioneer Earl Scruggs and novelist Kurt Vonnegut among his friends. He has been the most unusual singer songwriter...one who didn't recycle himself after the first album. He married folk music's narrative drive to country music's melodicism and economy. And when Alan Jackson took his song Little Bitty  to the top of the country charts in 1996, it proved that it's always a little premature to write off Tom T. Hall.  Country music began with narrative ballads, but no one has stretched the medium or used it as a vehicle to say something trenchant about the human condition like Tom T. Hall. If most country songwriters look inward, he looks outward with ironic detachment. He was raised on traditional bluegrass music, and still says that it's his favorite music, but bluegrass is rife with judgmentalism. Tom T. Hall's music is almost entirely free of judgments. He relates the story, leaving you to draw what conclusion you will.", "title": "Definitive Collection"}
{"description": "In 1986, Steve Earle made a powerful enough entrance to mainstream country to establish himself for years to come. A decade later, he was someone else entirely.  Earle, it turned out, was an artist far more complex than Nashville was accustomed to. When he did things the Music Row way, doors opened. But within a couple of years he began an unexpected 360 by embracing less fashionable musical forms, winning a near-lethal struggle with substance abuse and reinventing himself. As an artist courageously addressing serious social issues, he confronted matters that politically and socially conservative Nashville could not  would not abide, not in the 1960s, the 1980s or the first years of the new Century.  It would have been simple for Steve Earle to simply play the game. But in the end he summoned the courage (that 'fearless heart' he sang of) to not only triumph over problems that could have killed him, he took risks to set his own artistic path. By doing so, he's created an enduring body of work that has yet to end. First Multi-Label Retrospective On This Important Modern Singer-Songwriter.

{"title": "Definitive Collection", "description": "In the dazzling history of our popular culture, no figure is more compelling than Sammy Davis, Jr. No figure is more crucial to understanding the changes in American entertainment from the forties through the seventies. No figure is more charismatic. A multi-talented performer, Davis recorded forty albums and made countless film, television and Las Vegas appearances in his lifetime. Beyond his complexities and contradictions, Sammy never failed to entertain on a spectacularly high level. This compilation lives up to that level. This Collection has Sammy singing at the apex of his powers  singing joyfully, passionately,  brilliantly and swinging like there's no tomorrow. First-ever career-spanning, single disc, multi-label retrospective of one the world's greatest entertainers.

{"description": "In the hierarchy of funk, no artist has been more exciting, more inspired and 'badder' than the Super Freak himself, Slick Rick a.k.a. Rick James. His bass heavy songs and his outrageous persona set the standard for hardcore funk, what he dubbed 'punk funk'. For funksters ever since, James hits like 'Love  Gun', 'Super Freak' and 'Give It To Me, Baby' have been among the guiding lights of the genre. Motown. 2006.", "title": "Definitive Collection"}
{"description": "Is there an early rock & roller who has a crazier reputation than the Killer, Jerry Lee Lewis? His exploits as a piano-thumping egocentric wild man with an unquenchable thirst for living have become the fodder for numerous biographies, film documentaries, and a full-length Hollywood movie. When he broke on the national scene in 1957 with his classic Whole Lot Of Shakin' Going On,  he was every parents' worst nightmare perfectly realized: a long, blonde-haired southerner who played the piano and sang with uncontrolled fury and abandon, while simultaneously reveling in his own sexuality. He was rock & roll's first great wild man and also rock & roll's first great eclectic. Ignoring all manner of musical boundaries is something that has not only allowed his music to have wide variety, but to survive the fads and fashions as well.", "title": "Definitive Collection"}
{"title": "Definitive Collection", "description": "It always seems instructive to begin any discussion of Buddy Holly's much-deserved place in pop music pantheon by noting that at the time of his death in that fateful February 3, 1959 plane crash that also claimed the lives of Ritchie Valens and J.P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson, Holly was not yet even halfway past his 22nd birthday, and had been in the limelight for scarcely more than a year and a half.  Nonetheless, few legacies have proven as durable, or as daunting, as this archetypal Southwestern youth who, through his songs and style, captured no only the lightning-in-the-bottle excitement of the rock 'n' roll revolution going on around him in the 1950's, but also the imagination of generations of performers to come.

{"description": "It's hard to believe that Lee Greenwood did not arrive in Nashville until his late 30s, celebrating his first hit at 37. But by that time, he had become a consummate musician. He started with a saxophone at age 10, learned piano and bass, and formed his first band, the Moonbeams, while still in junior high school in Sacramento, California. He turned down a music scholarship to the College of the Pacific, abandoned a promising career as a baseball player and even skipped his graduation ceremony to start a job in a Reno, Nevada, hotel with his band the Apollos. Reno, followed by Las Vegas, provided invaluable training for Greenwood and finally paid off when he met Larry McFadden, who was then playing bass for Mel Tillis in Reno. McFadden eventually brought Greenwood to Nashville and actually managed him through his first seven years in country music. In Nashville, Jerry Crutchfield, then head of the MCA Music publishing company,  signed Greenwood as a staff writer and produced his first session where Greenwood's unique blending of R&B; vocal chops and country music fused into a top 20 hit with  It Turns Me Inside Out.  Only two years after his debut, Greenwood was voted the Country Music Association's Male Vocalist of the Year for 1983.  The following year he won that award again, as well as the Grammyr for Best Country Vocal Performance. By 1985, he was recognized for his songwriting talents by the CMA, winning Song of the Year for  God Bless The USA,  a song that continues to inspire and take on new meanings as America faces its many trials and tribulations.", "title": "Definitive Collection"}
{"title": "Definitive Collection", "description": "Just over 20 years ago, long before the coining of the terms \"new adult contemporary\" and \"smooth jazz,\" keyboardist Jeff Lorber generated a loyal following for a synthesis of sound so fresh and distinctive that only one name could really define it: the Jeff Lorber Fusion. Drawing elements from the artists he admired--Earth, Wind & Fire,Tower of Power,Miles Davis, andWeather Report--Lorber fashioned a jazzy funk hybrid that--with the exception of a few disco effects--sounds more fresh than retro even today.The Definitive Collectionpicks gems from the six Jeff Lorber Fusion LPs that Arista released between 1979 and 1985. The buoyant funk tune \"Fusion Juice\" sums up the spirit and percussive energy the band had and that the keyboardist has carried into his popular 1990s work. The 16 tracks perfectly represent a time that postdates hard-core, early 1970s jazz-fusion and predates smooth jazz. Despite the glorious melodies, beautiful keyboard passages, and irresistible funk, a few of the spacey synth solos are conspicuously cornball when played today. While Lorber lovers and serious modern-jazz collectors will no doubt thrill to get their hands on this wealth of classic material, fans of both smooth jazz and pop music who don't know Lorber fromCount Basiemay want to hear it for another reason: the early development of a then-obscure Seattle saxophonist known as Kenny Gorelick (later known as multimillion sellingKenny G). G fans will immediately recognize his soprano tones on the dreamy \"Tierra Verde\" but will have a harder time picking out his funkier style in the slamming, discoesque \"Fusion Juice.\" This collection is perfect for fans of Lorber's recent smooth-jazz recordings as well as longtime fans that would love to hear these classics fully remastered, without pops and hisses.--Jonathan Widran"}

His visibility seems to increase, rather than fade, with the passing years, and though the Viagra commercial that used  I'm Ready  as its backing track made some blues purists wince, it nevertheless made its point. In 2002 author Robert Gordon published his definitive full-length biography of Muddy, called I Can't Be Satisfied  (Little, Brown); the following year Gordon produced a documentary with the same title which aired on public television. Muddy's songs continue to be covered, not only by today's up and coming young blues bands, but by rock and pop artists as well, keeping his name and music before successive generations of fans."}

If a soul can soar over the rainbow  scaling earthly adversities in divinely inspired bounds, spreading rings of warmth around the planet, and shaking out blues like a dusty rug during spring cleaning that dynamo would belong to Sister Patti. For over four decades, she has been a recording artist unparalleled. More importantly she has been a beacon of fortitude and a ball of flashy fire for a legion of fans that like their 'sangas' unbridled and electrifying! When you've been blessed with a voice that commands ovations, awe and respect, not to mention a stage presence that flat out floors folks, you accept with those gifts enormous responsibility.

He was a pioneer in the use of controlled harmonics, and although this technique has been used by rock's greatest guitarists, especially Jeff Beck, Robbie Robertson and Z.Z.

{"description": "This 20-track career overview's problems are summed up by the differences between two songs. \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again,\" released in 1969, came near the end of Warwick's classic collaborative period withBurt Bacharachand Hal David; contrast its witty approach to heartbreak (\"What do you get when you kiss a guy?&nbsp;/&nbsp;You get enough germs to catch pneumonia&nbsp;/&nbsp;And after you do, he'll never phone ya\") with \"I'll Never Love This Way Again,\" the single that launched her chart comeback a decade later. That track encapsulates everything wrong with late-'70s easy listening, right down to the turgidBarry Manilowproduction. Saddest, though, is Warwick's capitulation to empty displays of technique over the perfectly sung vulnerability she specialized in with Bacharach and David.

Craig is a selectorpar excellence, digging through the crates to find music which is dance-floor friendly, but challenging and interesting as well. There's a strong emphasis on material from his seminal Planet E label, and these make for the high points of the mix. Gemini's \"A Moment of Insanity\" and 4th Wave's \"Electroluv,\" as well as \"Jak the Basics\" from Clark (a.k.a. LFO's Mark Bell), are all inventive and emotional dance-floor masterpieces.

Here, he presents the next installment of K7's esteemedDJ Kicksseries. With over two decades of involvement with music under his belt and no associations to any fixed genre, Jackson must have had a nightmare trying to slim his options down to album length.

The tracks compiled here, though expertly woven together, abide by the relentless march so much of the music has become. Every track is excellent in its own right--who can argue with Dillinja, DJ Die, or J Majik?--and in fact no CD offers a better snapshot of big-label jungle circa 1998. But the surprise, innovation, and good times you'll find on some of the music's second-tier labels aren't here. That doesn't makeDJ Kicksbad--in its own monochromatic way it's quite bracing--but it does make it an unsatisfactory swan song for one of jungle's great figures.--Jeff Salamon"}

{"title": "Dreamland", "description": "Compressing the diverse highlights of Joni Mitchell's four-decade career into the hour-and-change confines of a single CD seems like an unfair challenge. But with Mitchell herself tackling the anthologizing,Dreamlandplays like a warm reintroduction to an old, if ever mercurial, musical friend. Taking nothing for granted, Mitchell shrewdly anchors the set with two of her early jazz-infused commercial breakthroughs, \"Free Man in Paris\" and \"In France&#x85;,\" before charting an elliptical course through one of the most consistently inspired song canons in all of pop music. While familiar hits are well-represented, the collection also widens to include her forays with Afrocentric rhythms (\"The Jungle Line,\" title track) and her tribute to a beloved blues legend (\"Furry Sings the Blues\"). Indeed, the choices here are often as playfully surprising as the tantalizing omissions: \"Dancin' Clown,\" her unlikely '80s collaboration withTom PettyandBilly Idol, is included yet there's nothing from the sublimely challengingMingus. It all wends to an elegiac triptych from her latter-day symphonic reinventions (TravelogueandBoth Sides Now), their postmodern elegance informed by the bittersweet knowledge that Mitchell undertook a self-imposed recording hiatus thereafter. Richly illustrated with the musician's own distinctive paintings, the 17-track collection also includes new liner notes by writer-director Cameron Crowe.--Jerry McCulley"}

{"title": "Dreamland", "description": "It's Dale Watson's misfortune to flaunt a devotion to straight-no-chaser honky-tonk at a time when Nashville prefers its country with about as much kick as buttermilk. Indeed, it's tempting to imagine the response an album as solid and occasionally inspired asDreamlandwould have received in the heyday ofMerle HaggardandGeorge Jones. WithAsleep at the Wheel's Ray Benson at the production helm, Watson's hard edges are softened a bit on this 12-song collection, but he's still got the perspective and pipes for putting across barroom laments that may be unsurpassed among his contemporaries. The conservational delivery of \"I Wish You'd Come Around\" and the masculine wistfulness of the title track are as stirring as they are effortless. Watson seems destined to haunt the fringes of country music, where connoisseurs of hardcore honky-tonk gather to toast a master who's had the hard luck to come along a couple of decades too late to get his just rewards.--Steven Stolder"}
{"title": "Dreamland", "description": "Kevin Baker'sDreamlandis the kind of novel that begins with a two-page list of characters and ends with a nine-page glossary. In between, this vast, sprawling carnival of a book takes in Coney Island and the Lower East Side, midgets and gangsters, Bowery bars and opium dens, even Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. It is, in short, a novel as big, lively, and ambitious as Gotham itself, and if you can stomach some of the more garish local color, it's every bit as much fun. Set at the turn of the century, in a New York as polyglot as any city on earth,Dreamlandopens with an act of misplaced--and very stupid--compassion. Eastern European immigrant Kid Twist intervenes when villainous gangster Gyp the Blood is on the verge of murdering a young newsboy for sport. But surprise: that's no street urchin--that's Trick the Dwarf, self-proclaimed Mayor of Little City and a Coney Island tout, who dresses up as a boy, he says, as \"a way I had of leaving myself behind.\" Trick hides Kid Twist in the hind parts of the Tin Elephant Hotel; Kid Twist meets Esther Abramowitz, impoverished seamstress and labor agitator, then falls in love; Trick woos Mad Carlotta, a three-foot beauty who thinks she's the Empress of Mexico; and Freud and Jung sail for America, where they squabble about psychoanalysis. There are also a few subplots involving police corruption, Tammany Hall, and the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire--but who's counting? Suffice to say that it all really does come together in the end, and you won't be bored for one step of the way. Baker served as chief historical researcher for Harold Evans'sThe American Century, and it's clear that he put his time there to good use;Dreamlandis full of vivid historical detail, from Lower East Side slang to the lyrics of popular songs. If this is middlebrow entertainment, it's middlebrow in the same way as Dickens: extravagantly plotted, elegantly written, and compassionate to the core.--Mary Park--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

With him she could be anybody,  not just the second-rate shadow of her older sister, Cass. But now she is  drowning in the vacuum Cass left behind when she turned her back on her family's  expectations by running off with a boyfriend. Caitlin wanders in a dream land of  drugs and a nightmare of Rogerson's sudden fists, lost in her search for  herself.Why do so many girls allow themselves to get into abusive relationships--and  what keeps them there? In this riveting novel, Sarah Dessen searches for  understanding and answers. Caught in a trap that is baited with love and need,  Caitlin must frantically manage her every action to avoid being hit by the hands  that once seemed so gentle. All around her are women who care--best friends,  mother, sister, mentor--but shame keeps her from confiding in any of them,  especially Cass, her brilliant older sister, whose own flight from home had  seemed to point the way.Dessen has here created a subtle and compelling work of literature that goes far  beyond the teen problem novel in a story rich with symbolism, dark scenes of  paralyzing dread, quirky and memorable characters, and gleams of humor. With the  consummate skill and psychological depth that brought her praise forKeeping the Moon, she explores  the search for self-identity, the warmth of feminine friendships, and the  destructive ways our society sets up young women for love gone wrong.

{"title": "Dreamland", "description": "The look of the thing says horror, while the story is pure sci-fi.Dreamlandplays like a low-budget episode ofThe X-Filessans Mulder and Scully. It starts with a young couple, Megan (Jackie Kreisler) and Dylan (Shane Elliot), driving an old beater from Vegas to Reno to visit her parents. Along the way, they drop by a kitschy diner for a bite to eat. Decorated with all manner of alien paraphernalia, the shack is situated near Area 51. While there, the tobacco-chewing clerk (Jonathan Breck,Jeepers Creepers) tells the duo a fantastic tale about locals who travel through time. They write him off as a kook and continue on their way. When their car breaks down in the middle of the desert, the two get separated, and Megan encounters one strange thing after another: a spooky little girl, a dying soldier, and Adolph Hitler (a development far more ridiculous than scary). Eventually, they're reunited. Dylan claims he's fixed the car, so they return to the road, but something about him has changed. From that point onwards, the trip grows more bizarre until all the mysteries are resolved by montage. That seems to be the intention, at any rate. Written and directed by veteran soundman James Lay (House of 1000 Corpses),Dreamlandoffers an intriguing premise and a few minor frights, but the end result feels more like a rough draft than a finished film.--Kathleen C.

{"title": "Dreamland", "description": "With appealing charm, unaffected innocence, and a voice as pretty as the young Wayne Newton's, 13-year-old Michael Verschuere (hence the \"Junior\") performs a collection of European popular music and classical standards sweetly and unpretentiously. The Belgian wunderkind sings proficiently in five languages; the kid must learn one each year! His enjoyable voice is full-throated and punctuated by a mature vibrato, as he captures the casual swagger of the Italian popular style in \"Il Mondo,\" and croons the French standards with  joie de vivre. Most of the selections are interpreted in a simple and  straightforward manner, with a one-dimensional emotional range, not  surprising for an adolescent. This is particularly problematic, however, when  the boy tackles such classics as \"Ave Maria,\" and \"Panis Angelicus,\" which  demand interpretive embellishment to be musically satisfying.

Unfortunately, it's also one of the least enjoyable records of Sinatra's career. Part of the problem is Phil Ramone's obtrusively slick production, but the fact that Sinatra's partners sang along to tapes of his already-recorded performances--rather than with the Chairman himself--really keepsDuetsfrom ever catching fire. Tony Bennett turns in a predictably swell &quot;New York, New York,&quot; but duets with Gloria Estefan (&quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot;), Kenny G (&quot;All the Way/One More for My Baby&quot;) and U2's Bono (&quot;I've Got You Under My Skin&quot;) unfortunately represent something of an artistic low-point for Sinatra.--Dan Epstein", "title": "Duets"}

{"description": "Even in the face of epochal success, it's tempting to ponder what Barbra Streisand might have accomplished had she not spread herself across so many diverse entertainment media; so much ambition, so little time. This collection of 19 Streisand duets chronicles collaborations withFrank SinatraandJudy Garlandat one end of the scale andDon Johnsonat the other. It finds the singer dabbling--if, as her bluesy miscue withRay Charleson \"Crying Time\" argues, not necessarily triumphing--in styles she largely eschewed elsewhere in her career. Still, her unlikely collaborations with Barry Gibb (\"Guilty,\" \"What Kind of Fool\") andDonna Summer(\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough\") during the disco era scored her some of the biggest successes of her career, ample proof that with the right chemistry, Streisand could be as powerful a pop music chameleon as she was a diva.

The contrast between the saxophonists is still apparent, though, with Rollins bringing blunt authority and invention to Wheatleigh Hall and Stitt providing smooth elegance within the bop conventions. Pianist Ray Bryant can play some of the deepest blues of any modern jazz musician, and he imparts a special feel to the two headless blues with Stitt, \"Anythin'\" and \"Haute Mon'.\" These are blowing sessions with a special mix of the relaxed and the concentrated, with Gillespie, clearly inspired by his partners, tearing off some of his most incendiary solos of the period. --Stuart Broomer"}

After 20 years of development we are proud to introduce the new and improved Ear Band-It Ultra!What makes the Ear Band-It Ultra the best swimmer's headband on the market? The Ear Band-It Ultra is made from our custom-designed, embossed neoprene on the inner side of the headband providing extra grip on the forehead, ears, and back of the head to avoid slipping during most types of water activity. It also contains 4.0mm 100% neoprene instead of 2.0mm-3.0mm neoprene blend that other headbands use. This gives the Ear Band-It Ultra unparalleled strength and comfort. The unique shape of the Ear Band-It Ultra is different than the Original Ear Band-It headband and other swimming headbands. The ear flaps are larger which increases the surface area, creating more grip and better coverage of the ear itself. Also the bridge at the forehead has been widened, which adds strength, reduces the potential for tearing at this stress point, and increases skin contact surface area for better grip.Size SMALL: Recommended for ages 1 to 3. Fits head size range 16\"-20\"Size MEDIUM: Recommended for ages 4 to 9. Fits head size range 17\"-21\"Size LARGE: Recommended for ages 10 to Adult. Fits head size range 19.5\"-24\""}

{"title": "Escape", "description": "Escape, the 12th studio recording from pianist Jim Brickman, comes from a new label (SLG Records instead of Windham Hill) but follows a familiar formula, mixing instrumentals (nine of them) with radio-oriented vocal selections (three) in an effort to snare the largest possible audience and keep all camps in his fan base happy. The result is an easy-to-digest, easy-to-like disc that, in general, should make fans of Brickman's piano-only works content. While not as deeply evocative as his earliest releases,Escapefeatures some lovely instrumentals (\"Waterfall,\" \"Awakening,\" \"Big Sky,\" \"First Light,\" and \"Timeless\") that will remind longtime fans of what attracted them to Brickman in the first place. And two of the vocal tracks--\"Never Alone,\" sung by country artist Sara Evans, and the cheery \"When It Snows,\" handled by under-the-radar vocalist Geoff Byrd--are as engaging as any pop selections Brickman has previously recorded.

While the sheer horror of Campbell's crimes, along with a psychological defense based on  post-partum depression, could have been the basis for a thoughtful legal debate, Tanenbaum stacks the deck by saddling the defense with hack expert witnesses and makes a heavy-handed effort to parallel the defense theory with the suicidal jihadists, who also claim to act in the name of their god.

She recounts the horrid events that led her to break free from the oppressive world she knew and how she has managed to survive since escaping, despite threats and legal battles with her husband and the Church. Though sometimes her retelling overflows with colorful foreshadowing and commentary on how exceptional she is, the everyday details she reveals about this polygamous society are devastating and tragic.

After coming to stardom in the 1940s, Arnold took a place in the vanguard of the Nashville Sound, crooning pleasingly the likes of \"Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye\" and \"Just Call Me Lonesome.\" The former was first ahitfor vocal group the Casinos, but Arnold's songs likewise benefited noncountry artists; soul singersJoe SimonandDorothy Mooreboth cut his \"Moody Blue\" (not included here), and jazz singerHelen Merrillearlier tackled \"Anytime.\" This volume of RCA'sEssentialseries mostly lives up to its title while missing at least one obvious choice, the sweet \"Bouquet of Roses.\" Also, some of the later recordings slide perilously close toPerry Comoterritory. Still, Arnold's best records are hard to resist, and anyone interested in hearing where, say,Vince Gilllearned some lessons will want this CD.--Rickey Wright", "title": "Essential"}
{"title": "Essential", "description": "As much as any performer this side ofPatsy Cline, Jim Reeves exemplified the Nashville Sound.Chet Atkins's lush production fit like a cardigan sweater around the Texan's cozy baritone; it was a sound traditionalists believed was antithetical to true country music. Record buyers, however, begged to differ--in droves. The so-called countrypolitan movement produced its share of schlock, but Reeves had much going for him, most notably a knack for finding apropos material, including \"Welcome to My World,\" \"Four Walls,\" and \"He'll Have to Go.\" This 20-track overview features 20 trademark tunes cut between 1957 and his death in a 1964 plane crash. For refined rural Romeos and Juliets, these are the cozy tunes that established the country crooner as something of aNat King Colein cowboy boots.--Steven Stolder"}

{"title": "Essential", "description": "While Memphis's Stax Records was perfecting deep Southern soul in the mid- to late 1960s, small cross-town rival Goldwax was trying desperately and failing to keep up. But if nothing else, Goldwax deserves significant credit for unleashing James Carr, a gospel-steeped, hair-raising vocalist with enormous range and incredible passion. Carr was in some ways Goldwax's answer to Stax'sOtis Redding, but Carr's voice was even thicker and coarser than Redding's. The urgency and depth of feeling that Carr gives these 20 burning cuts are nothing short of astonishing, especially considering the fact that he was a quiet, confused, and troubled soul off-mic. Like Redding, Carr was a master at letting the music play him; when he lets loose with a screech, moan, or sigh, he almost sounds possessed while in its throes. If not for his personal problems, theEssential James Carrmight have wound up being a four-disc box set, but this collection of unparalleled country soul will have to suffice.--Marc Greilsamer"}

{"description": "Established jazz artists like vibraphonist Stefon Harris hold it on faith that their fans--and maybe some critics, too--will follow them when they gravitate toward the commercial side of the tracks with pop-informed albums. Still, even taking into account the need to reach a broader audience at a time when instrumental jazz has fallen out of favor,Evolutionseems like a step backward, not forward. As contemporary jazz--if not Contemporary Jazz--goes, this album is a cut above. Harris has a great ear for melody, a gift for intoxicating, offbeat arrangements, and a knack for sublimating influences ranging from funk to fusion. (He is abetted in the latter style byMarc Cary, who often sounds likeReturn to Forever-eraChick Coreaon electric piano.) But even if some of the performances get under your skin with repeated listening--a cover ofSting's ballad \"Until\" casts a sneaky spell--too much of the album is bland and predictable. While it's nice to hear Harris return from the rarified heights of hisGrand Unification Theorysuite and play with a working band again, he's capable of more evolutionary sounds than these.--Lloyd Sachs", "title": "Evolution"}

Each stage of our ancestry is represented by a character of  progressively increasing intelligence, empathy, and brain size, who must  survive predation and other perils long enough to keep the  natural-selection ball rolling. While Baxter carefully follows some widely  accepted theories of evolution--punctuated equilibrium, for instance--he  also strays from the known in postulating air whales and sentient,  tool-wielding dinosaurs. And why not? There's nothing in the fossil  record to contradict his musings about those things, or about the first  instances of mammalian altruism and deception, which he also lets us  observe. From little Purga, a shrewlike mammal scurrying under the feet  of ankylosaurs, all the way through Ultimate, the last human descendant,  Baxter adds drama and a strong story arc to our past and future. But he  spends too much time on details of the various prehumans' lives, which  can become repetitive: fight, mate, die, ad infinitum.

{"description": "For nearly 60 years, pianist John Lewis has co-led theModern Jazz Quartetand successfully fused Bach, bop, and the blues into his own brilliant musical conception. He's recorded only twice as a solo pianist, which makes this offering all the more special. Alone at the keyboard, the New Mexico-raised Lewis displays the kind of spare and swinging pianism that recalls the \"storytelling\" style that madeCount Basieand saxophonistLester Youngfamous. Lewis's sly, rollicking version of \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" is a superb example of how to swing and embellish without wasting notes, as are his takes on the standards, \"I'll Remember April,\" \"Willow Weep for Me,\" \"Cherokee,\" and \"Don't Blame Me.\" Lewis's invigorating improvisation breathes new life into his own compositions. \"Afternoon in Paris\" is blessed with an engaging lyrical melody. \"Two Degrees East, Three Degrees West\" rings with the cool hues of the blues, while \"At the Horse Show\" is an impromptu, fleet-fingered workout. Lewis's \"Django\" is moving elegy to guitaristDjango Reinhardt, rendered in a mournful, Ravelian mood, and \"For Ellington\" is performed in the same saintly and sanctified aural image of \"Come Sunday\" and \"Heaven\" by this underrated master of African-American piano.--Eugene Holley Jr.", "title": "Evolution"}

{"description": "`Review from previous edition I felt I must write and congratulate you and thank you for the excellent text-book you and your co-author......have written. I am full of admiration of your skill in writing briefly and succinctly and yet cover so much ground and making it clear that in many cases things are not all that straightforward. As has been said, any fool can write a thick book but it takes talent to write a short one. I am convinced your book will be widely used and make splendid service in many years to come.' Staffan Ulfstrand at Uppsala.`..a nice, slim, inexpensive, up-to-date, user-friendly textbook pitched at exactly the right level...Stearns and Hoekstra excel both on presentation and content. The uncluttered pages and numerous sub-headings are inviting...The questions at the end of each chapter are thought provoking...the best undergraduate evolution textbook available.'

{"title": "Evolution", "description": "''This new [textbook in evolutionary biology] by Barton and colleagues is among the best. The production quality is superb in layout, composition, typesetting, colour palette, illustrations and gorgeous half-tones; and the writing is excellent, as one might expect from such a stellar cast of experts in population genetics, palaeontology, human genetics, bacterial genomics and developmental biology (respectively).'' --Daniel Hartl, Harvard University (Nature)''The book has many strengths. The prose is crisp and explanations are rigorous but clear. The authors do not hesitate to discuss complex ideas or to provide appropriate caveats about the certainty of our knowledge. The Figures are useful and abundant...The expertise of the authors in quantitative, population, and developmental genetics is obvious; explanations are often less formal than in other texts, but at the same time are more sophisticated and more intuitive. The chapters on diversity include a detailed but engaging introduction to the genetics and genomics of bacterial and archaeal diversity, the origins of multicellularity, and the evolution of novelty inferred from both fossil data and from developmental biology. Although I had assured myself that I would not read the text word-for-word, I found myself deeply immersed in many chapters and read them from beginning to end. The material was not new (for me), but the descriptions and explanations seemed fresher and more compelling than in other current evolution texts. The explicit focus on questions at the molecular level determines the use of examples throughout the text, but these examples come from basic biology, not biomedical science. This book will be particularly attractive to molecular biologists who want to learn the details of evolutionary pattern and process. It may also be the book of choice for evolutionary biology graduate students with interests in population genetics, ''evo-devo,'' and molecular evolution.'' --Richard G. Harrison, Cornell University, Ithaca (Evolution)''At 833 pages,Evolutionby Barton et al. is a large book, and it is copiously and helpfully illustrated with photos, figures and line drawings, mostly in color. The lion's share consists of Part II, ''The Origin and Diversification of Life,'' and Part III, ''Evolutionary Processes.'' The three chapters of Part I introduce the history of evolutionary biology, including molecular biology, and the evidence for evolution. The final two chapters, in Part IV, provide an excellent, up-to-date summary of human evolution. The discussion of the Out-of-Africa and multiregional hypotheses of the origin of modern humans is nuanced rather than dogmatic. A section on ''Genomics and Humanness'' is brief but incisive. The final chapter on ''Current Issues in Human Evolution'' is exemplary and can be profitably read by medical geneticists seeking to establish associations between genes and diseases.The expertise of Barton et al. in population and evolutionary genetics is eminently displayed in Part III, which makes up somewhat more than half of Evolution. All the bases are covered, and well covered at that: mutation and variation, population structure, random drift and gene flow, selection, social evolution, speciation, and much more...The last two chapters of Part III, ''Evolution of Genetic Systems'' and ''Evolution of Novelty,'' are priceless. In length, depth and excitement, these two chapters go far beyond what is typically covered in evolution textbooks. The increasingly relevant topic of the evolution of evolvability is helpfully included, and evo devo considerations are again brought to bear in these chapters.'' --Francisco J. Ayala, University of California, Irvine (Nature Genetics)"}

{"title": "Exodus", "description": "Kindergarten-Grade 4-Wildsmith recounts Moses's saga from his rescue in the bulrushes by Pharaoh's daughter to his death on Mt. Nebo overlooking the Promised Land. The writing is straightforward and simple; the story is brief but accurate. The artwork is a visual feast. The double-page illustrations, framed in gold, are panoramas of activity, crowded with the figures of the Hebrew multitudes suffering in slavery, streaming out of Egypt, traversing the Red Sea between walls of water, wandering in the brown hills of the desert, and at last, triumphantly entering the verdant Canaan. Filled with meticulous and decorative detail, glowing with rich colors, and arranged to maximize dramatic impact, the paintings show the awesome events with excitement and beauty. The pillars of cloud and fire are shaped like huge pointing fingers. Animals, birds, and sea life abound. God's presence is shown by a multicolored, starry shape superimposed on a sphere. The endpapers present the Ten Commandments printed on monumental, gold-decorated arks against a background of intense violet and rose. Even if your library has Leonard Everett Fisher's excellent Moses (1995) or Miriam Chaikin's Exodus (1987, both Holiday), powerfully illustrated by Charles Mikolaycak, this new book should be included.Patricia Pearl Dole, formerly at First Presbyterian School, Martinsville, VACopyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

People are troubled and anxious.  Finances are tumbling, rockets are launching, and seemingly solid institutions are teetering.  It's tough for folks to know where to turn.Two years ago I began writing a new book entitledFearless.  Little did I know then what we'd be facing now, but God did.  The book examines Jesus' statements about fear  and encourages us to take heart in difficult times.The antidote to the fear epidemic?  Trust.  If we trust God more, we can fear less.  What a comforting promise.-Max LucadoA Message from Thomas Nelson PublishersFor the past few years we have seen a rejuvenated Max Lucado.  Since taking a different step in his role at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, TX Max has devoted more of his time to writing and preaching, thus he is more in his \"sweet spot.\"Fearlessis a wonderful result of that by addressing the issue of Fear in our world, our community, and our personal lives.   This year, he hosted a town hall on fear at his church and was able to receive questions from the attendees and readers on Twitter, Facebook, e-mail, and by phone.  It was encouraging to see Max help them realize that that they are not alone and can fight fear with the help of God, their family, friends, and at church.  With the growth of social media, our team has had the ability to dialogue with Max Lucado readers on a whole new level.  It has been encouraging to hear their stories of overcoming fear whether it may be facing financial ruin, fighting a difficult relationship, going into a serious surgery, figuring out how to be calm and protecting their children, etc.  It has helped our team recognize more than ever how important a message likeFearlessis to everyday people.  People are left inspired by Max Lucado.  My hope is that someday you will be able to meet Max Lucado in person. He is as geniune of a person as he is in his books.In 2010, it is Max's 25th Anniversary in publishing and he will working toward the goal of sponsoring 25,000 children through World Vision.  His book \"Outlive Your Life\" will help capture the spirit of service that we as Christians must embrace just as the early church did in the book of Acts.  We hope you will also be inspired by these words.  Thank you Amazon and readers for your support of Max through the years.--Dave Schroeder, Sr. Director of Marketing, Thomas Nelson Publishers--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}
{"description": "Clothed in an attitude of worship, Crystal Lewis' 16th release is an album of promise and hope. Aptly titledFearless, these pop/R&B;  songs take an intimate journey through the heart, unveiling God's trustworthy care for our every need. \"One Man,\" a dynamic depiction of Christ's redemptive and liberating nature, pinpoints the essence of the project: \"One man who takes care of us&nbsp;/ One man who is big enough&nbsp;/ One man who sees every hurt&nbsp;/ One man who can change the earth&nbsp;/ One man who takes all the pain of everyone who calls his name.\" The nuances of Lewis's seasoned vocal and lyrical expression give a glimpse into her soul. Her confidence is genuinely centered in Christ's faithfulness, and the aroma of this faithfulness permeates every song. Singing since the age of 4, Lewis has trained her voice to soar into ecstasy or hover in sweet quietness. The atmospheric programming of \"Reach Out\" and the groove-laden sway of \"Satisfied\" set the foundations from which she contrasts her relaxed and vivacious moods. Other elements that fans have come to expect, such as creative production, soulful melodies, and down-to-earth attitude, are all present in perfect form.--Israel Button", "title": "Fearless"}

{"description": "While Nashville's unwritten rules say Terri Clark should just recycle her spunky-yet-slight early hits, she has instead grown more willing to reject New Country formula with each new album. On 2000'sFearless, she eschews the overinflated production and nervous energy of most current country in favor of arrangements that are frequently nothing more than her voice backed by acoustic midtempo rhythm tracks. And her songs, cowritten with folks likeMary Chapin Carpenter,Kim Richey, andBeth Nielsen Chapman, have her experimenting with a shoe-gazing angst and have a downright singer-songwriter feel. All interesting developments, but often foiled by vocals that can be oddly tentative, lyrics that search only hard enough to discover different clich&eacute;s, and stripped-down arrangements that go nowhere. Still, cuts like the easy-rocking \"Getting There,\" where the journey beats the destination, and the spare, closing \"Good Mother,\" where \"Be yourself\" is repeated like a mantra, hint Clark may still have something substantial to offer, even if it hasn't completely come out yet.--David Cantwell", "title": "Fearless"}

{"description": "Bobby Brown has a chip the size of Florida on his shoulder; does that mean his art is going to suffer? Absolutely. Even before the proper album begins, he's got wife Whitney Houston singing his praises with a snippet of &quot;Nobody Does It Better.&quot; On the first track, &quot;It's Still My Thang,&quot; he declares that, &quot;It's still my prerogative.&quot; After letting us know that he is the best and he ain't gonna change (while slyly reminding us he was once capable of turning out actual hits), Bobby proceeds to turn out the real sludge: a bucket full of songs ensnared by slick soul balladery, senseless tabloid bashing, and glossy late '80s New Jack production. When Brown made his solo debut on the pop charts, he was an uncompromising talent, hungry for success and critical recognition. At the height of his creative powers, with songs like &quot;My Prerogative&quot; and &quot;Don't Be Cruel,&quot; he delivered a Head kick to the stagnant late-'80s R&B; scene. Now he's singing syrupy ballads like &quot;She's All I Need&quot; and &quot;My Place,&quot; songs so saccharine  that they wouldn't even make the cut on an Isaac Hayes B-sides album.--Aidin Vaziri", "title": "Forever"}

The fifth album from Cracker finds principal songwriter and frontman David Lowery finally and fully integrating his more recent leanings with the sound of his previous band,Camper Van Beethoven. So, in addition to the garage-rock Americana that defined Cracker's preceding albums,Foreveradds a healthy dose of Camper Van's eclecticism, especially on tracks like \"Guarded by Monkeys\" and the Johnny Hickman-penned \"Superfan.\" Lowery's wit is still in top form (\"God gave you life / So stay out of mine / And take your sorry ass back to Florida\" he spits on \"Don't Bring Us Down\"), and Hickman's guitar work is as fierce as ever. Some old friends turn up on some of the best tracks (Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous contributes guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals to album opener, \"Brides of Neptune\"). And even though they do occasionally stumble (the band's attempt at rap on \"What You're Missing\" is more pathetic than funny),Foreverfeatures some of Cracker's best work sinceKerosene Hat.--Robert Burrow"}

{"title": "Forever", "description": "&quot;Going all the way&quot; is still a taboo subject in young adult literature. Judy Blume was the first author to write candidly about a sexually active teen, and she's been defending teenagers' rights to read about such subjects ever since. Here, Blume tells a convincing tale of first love--a love that seems strong and true enough to last forever. Katherine loves Michael so much, in fact, that she's willing to lose her virginity to him, and, as the months go by, it gets harder and harder for her to imagine living without him. However, something happens when they are separated for the summer: Katherine begins to have feelings for another guy. What does this mean about her love for Michael? What does this mean about love in general? What does &quot;forever&quot; mean, anyway? As always, Blume writes as if she's never forgotten a moment of what it's like to be a teenager.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}

Gone are the cuddly wannabes of yesteryear, replaced by thinner, tougher  glamazons of the new millenniumSpice World. ButForever's strategy is a serious misstep--one that will disappoint their old fans and alienate new ones. \"Holler,\" the first single, is standard-issue urban pop, with a beat you've heard before and terribly generic lyrics, promising to make you \"do things you thought you would never do.\" As a matter of fact, you've heard all of this before: for \"Tell Me Why,\" the Girls bite the computer-generated voice fromTLC'sFan Mail, and borrow the vocoder fromCher's \"Believe\" sessions. \"Right Back at Ya,\" their official comeback anthem, is trite and predictable: \"Our friendship is forever,\" Baby Spice testifies. \"You thought we wouldn't make it this far,\" Sporty sneers, and she's right.

{"title": "Free", "description": "English composer Robert Prizeman has taken a conventional English boy's choir--usually a haven for sweet songs and ecclesiastical renderings--and made them contemporary without selling out any of their intrinsic charm. Their stacked choral voices and lead sopranos, dressed up with electronica rhythms, synthesizers, and strings still sound like they could be coming from the church balcony, even while they exude anEnya-like appeal. While there are adaptations of Gregorian chants and Sibelius hymns, most of the songs are Prizeman originals based on those styles, with texts often drawn from Latin Liturgy. Except for the chilled romanticism of \"Stay With Me,\" and the rhythm driven \"Adoramus,\" whose chorus sounds like a Harry Potter incantation, few of the songs onFreehave the anthemic pop appeal of \"Salva Me\" or \"Vespera\" from previous albums. Instead, Prizeman has opted for a more serene sound onFree, even with their first video from the disc, the yearning \"I Am the Day.\" Some of it, like Prizeman's setting of a Walter de la Mare poem on \"A Song of Enchantment,\" gets lugubrious. But most ofFreefloats on gentle soprano breezes, intrinsically innocent, even if the boys might be smoking cigarettes behind the altar. --John Diliberto"}
{"title": "Free", "description": "If there1s a sling or an arrow that could be directed against progressive metal - or worse, a prog metal super group - it1s that the work often turns out to sound like a loose-bolted, duct-taped monster resembling the sum of disparate parts.

O.S.I. or Office of Strategic Influence released their first, self-titled CD in February of 2003 and to this day it remains one of Inside Out Music1s best selling titles. As with the first release, Free features the incredible musical talents of Jim Matheos (Fates Warning) on guitar, Kevin Moore (ex-Dream Theater, Chroma Key) on vocals and keyboards, and Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater) on drums.

Together they&#x92;re emphasizing a lighter, spacious, more natural sound. They&#x92;ve continued to reduce the heavy synthesizer tracks, spotlighting Bugnon&#x92;s acoustic piano and Fender Rhodes with strong melodies, light funk grooves and bright percussive detail. The band is made up of crack session players, including strong contributions from soprano saxophonist Vincent Henry, who coils in and out of the title track, and bassist Victor Bailey. Davis&#x92;s production values come to the fore here, adding rhythmic insinuation with exotic world-beat detail on tracks like \"Sierra Leone.\" As usual, Bugnon&#x92;s piano sound has a special resonance.

{"title": "Full Circle", "description": "Bunn mixes romance and light suspense in a proficient but somewhat lackluster read. Protagonist Adam Wright is a formerly self-absorbed actor turned crack investment analyst who is bitter about his father's abandonment. When he's hired by investment house Oxford Ventures, he falls hard for the boss's daughter, Kayla Austin. She has her own woes: her fianc&eacute; has embezzled the money from the African relief project she was spearheading, leaving her brokenhearted and her venture virtually bankrupt. Together, Kayla and Adam seek to heal past wounds and discover who's sabotaging Kayla's father's company. Bunn (Heirs of Acadia series; The Lazarus Trap) successfully uses the rich backdrop of Oxford, England, as his setting, but the suspense never moves past a gentle simmer. The pacing slows in places; the romance between Kayla and Adam lacks much tension; and occasionally, Bunn resorts to stale prose such as \"The air was spiced with Kayla's fragrance, and the heady scent of a better tomorrow.\" One bright spot is the story's sensitive handling of faith: Much of the plot hinges on what various characters intuit about God's leading, but in Bunn's capable hands, this is less forced than one might think. Bunn is a proficient writer, and despite its flaws, his fans should find this a mostly smooth read with a redemptive conclusion.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Still, a genuine ardor seeps through the tracks, and Reid's meticulous production makes this outing a far stronger and more satisfying effort than the Boyz' last album, 2000'sNathan, Michael, Shawn, and Wanya.--Sylvia W.

In contrast toCasual'sthunderous presence, Pep strikes like lightning and the two complement each other well on the thoughtful \"Make Your Move.\"Souls'member Opio also stands out, especially on \"Heatish\" where he sprints off with outrageous lines like, \"they know my skills/fire swept through your dialect/like the Oakland Hills.\" No song onFull Circleseems to offer the same crew combinations twice and the Hiero's longevity manifests in their enviable chemistry with one another.

This tale of adolescent lust, unrequited love, fumbled friendship and domestic contentment arcs across five decades: Ned Brummel and Jack Grace, best friends since their 1950s boyhoods, have been estranged for years when the imminent death (heart attack, not AIDS) of Andy Kowalski, the charismatic cad they both fell for during college, draws them back together. The trio's lives, recounted in lengthy flashbacks, intertwine somewhat melodramatically through the years: Ned and Andy serve together in Vietnam in the '60s, Ned shares a Castro-neighborhood apartment with Jack and Andy in the sex-drenched '70s, and all three meet again in New York as AIDS ravages the gay community through the '80s-before an accretion of heartbreak and bitterness drive them apart. The characters' many brushes with homosexual history-Harvey Milk trolling for votes in gay bars, the unfurling of the first Rainbow Flag, the sexual energy of early ACT UP meetings-will resonate with gay readers.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "Guest-star projects can be such tiresome affairs. Too often, the high-profile \"friend\" is nothing more than the record label's idea of someone they can feature on the front cover to generate additional sales. Additionally, these performances are frequently overdubbed, so the artist and the guest never actually come in contact with each other. Thankfully, neither is the case on Walter Trout's first studio album of new material since 2001'sGo the Distance. Not only has the hotshot guitarist worked and maintained friendships with these players, but they convened in the same studio at the same time to nail these tunes. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of Trout's friends are guitarists who--like him--prefer to charge through songs with the intensity of a salmon swimming upstream. Joe Bonamassa, Bernard Allison, Guitar Shorty, Jeff Healey, Junior Watson, and Coco Montoya all share guitar-duel duties, and while the results aren't exactly subtle, there's enough explosive firepower here to level a small building. Even an acoustic session with Eric Sardinas--a neighbor of Trout's--attacks like an unplugged Rory Gallagher on a hot Belfast night. John Mayall (keyboards/vocals), James Harman (harp), Finis Tasby (vocals), Deacon Jones (Hammond B3 organ), and Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward also bring their game faces, and sometimes songs, contributing to various tracks with energy and intensity. Trout plays with his usual all-stops-out bluster, but there is an obvious affection for his guests on every track, which both energizes and spurs him on to new heights on what is arguably his best and most diverse effort yet.--Hal Horowitz", "title": "Full Circle"}

{"title": "Full Circle", "description": "The usual cast of dysfunctional characters is present in this rambling, overpopulated tale of family entanglements by the author of Good Girls. Burned out and suspended for making bad judgment calls in the E.R., trauma specialist Dr. Kate Madison returns to her Louisiana hometown for some much-needed R&R.; Things aren't much better there: Mama's dying of cancer; her old flame, Sam (with whom she'd had an extramarital affair), has just lost his wife; and her best friend, Amber, is getting back at her abusive husband, Deke, by fooling around with her teenage stepson. No one sheds a tear when Deke is murdered, and nearly everyone is under suspicion?especially Amber and her young lover. The author moves the story along by repeatedly allowing the characters to be caught in compromising sexual situations by family members; after the third such incident, the reader begins to lose interest in who's having sex with whom, as well as in who killed Deke?the only real surprise in this tired melodrama.Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

But even when Clements is exploring acoustic  psychedelia, as he does on \"White Room,\" or giving theBeatles' classic  \"Yesterday\" a bluegrass makeover, his playing is full of down-home  charm.

The failures are almost as excruciatingly embarrassing for the audience as they are for the performer. But when one gets a glimpse at one of the rare success stories: Ah! What a thing of beauty!

Laying down nine midtempo tracks that are full and crisp without wearing too glossy of a pop sheen, Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford create an aural world whereYesfans and those who like chart-toppers live in harmony. And whatever lyrical well Collins chooses to tap proves to be a gusher, whether he is dipping into reservoirs ofGabrielanmenace (\"Mama,\" \"Home by the Sea,\" \"Silver Rainbow\"), stealing a page from pop music's huge tome of conflicted-heart numbers (\"That's All,\" \"Taking It All To Hard\"), or getting just plain ol' ridiculous (\"Illegal Alien\").

{"title": "Gold", "description": "In his heyday, fans went to Don Williams concerts like they went to church--quietly, reverently. They might approach this set, with its 16 No. 1 hits, with similar devotion. The skeletal, small-band country-folk sound frames his guileless baritone so delicately that one could make a case for Williams as one of the fathers of New Age music. But these singles, no matter how soft and simple, refuse to recede into the background. That's partly because of the sing-along melodies, but mostly because he conveys these lyrics--which could be artsy (\"Good Ole Boys Like Me\") or brazenly direct even by Nashville standards (\"You're My Best Friend\")--with irresistible warmth, intimacy, and empathy. Forty songs may add up to more time than you care to spend in church in one sitting, but if you have this, you'll never need another Williams CD.--John Morthland"}
{"description": "It's more and more obvious that whatLinda Ederwants is aBarbra Streisand-type career, one built on a solid Broadway base but that reaches way beyond it. The multipleStar Searchwinner was launched by her stage appearance inJekyll and Hyde, which was written by husband Frank Wildhorn, and she remains committed to show tunes (as long as they're by Wildhorn) while sprinkling her albums with select covers. In this case, she tackles theBeatles' \"Here Comes the Sun,\" as well as \"Son of a Preacher Man,\" the soul classic popularized by Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. Among the Wildhorn offerings, the title track is the most auspicious, as it's an excerpt from a musical-in-progress about sculptor Camille Claudel. Much to her credit, Eder doesn't oversing, a trap that's often snared performers eager to impress.Gold's main drawback is that the arrangements remain on the safe side: you get the sense that Eder would more than rise to the occasion if she were confronted with more challenging material. Just like the Bee Gees helped Streisand produce one of her finest pop albums, Eder should hook up with some studio wizard who could push her around a bit.--Elisabeth Vincentelli", "title": "Gold"}

Miyuke and lover Grindl (known as the Lesbians in the small town where they have a decorating business) spend a month apart on separate, two-week vacations each year. This year, vacationing Miyuke spends her days as always, indulging in junk food and beer at the  local pub, reading a book a day and walking across fields and along the seaside cliffs, until she discovers a rock that glows golden in the afternoon sunlight. Impulsively, she decides to paint it gold, only to be seen doing so  by a pub regular, tall Mr. Hughes, who subsequently disappears from his usual spot at the bar. Confronted by two other pub regulars, short Mr. Hughes and Mr. Puw, Miyuke tells of the rock, and the three set off to find their compatriot. Rhodes's tale features lovely touches (such as the Children from Previous Relationships, a local band that's never played in public), and effortlessly ends an immaculately crafted story of minor perturbations and their unpredictable outcomes.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Gold", "description": "Torrential creativity has fast-forwarded the artistic evolution of formerWhiskeytownfrontman Ryan Adams from country-rock boy wonder (seeFaithless Street) to despondent troubadour with a 1960s fixation (his solo debutHeartbreaker), but it may also explain why listeners often need to wade through some pedestrian material just to find a few pearls of poetic excellence.Goldis no exception to that trend, a sometimes engaging middle-of-the-road roots-pop album that's both overlong (70 minutes) and at times overindulgent. There are high spots--such as the bouncy, breezy opener \"New York, New York\" and the plaintive ballad \"When the Stars Go Blue\" (which features a vocal turn reminiscent ofMorrissey)--but much of the disc gets lost in forests of indistinct guitars and plodding percussion that never nudges Adams into actually rocking.Goldis the work of a notoriously prolific songwriter who hasn't yet learned to play to his strengths, one whose execution doesn't yet match his vision.--Anders Smith Lindall"}

What this compilation does  is focus attention on the Cure's perennial unpredictability--the breathless  claustrophobia of \"Close to Me,\" the New Order-lite of \"The Walk,\" the brass- section embellished thrust of \"Why Can't I Be You.\" Oddly, chart-wise, the  Cure's lost weekend began immediately after \"Friday I'm in Love,\" their most  ebullient melodic moment and the ultimate \"clocking-off to kick those heels\"  anthem. But at least the inclusion of two new songs, \"Cut Here\" and \"Just Say  Yes\" (with Saffron from Republica), indicate that the Cure remain a healthy,  ongoing concern.--Kevin Maidment"}

{"title": "Greatest Hits", "description": "Brenda Fassie, whomTimeonce called \"the Madonna of the Townships,\" was one of South Africa's most beloved pop icons. She was born in Cape Town, moving to Johannesburg's Soweto township while in her early teens. Her first solo hit,Weekend Special, was an international sensation but fame arrived before she was mature enough to handle it. Her private life was marred by drug-and-alcohol-induced problems and abusive relationships. After years of alternating obscurity and comebacks, she releasedMemeza(Shout), followed by a string of hit albums. It seemed that all was finally well with her but she died in May 2004 at age 39. Like Janis Joplin and Judy Garland, Fassie lived and sang hard enough for ten during her short life. Traditionalists should note that the mainstream was her habitat. But her voice was an exquisite force of nature and her songs were the soundtrack of a generation. --Christina Roden"}

{"description": "Despite his ability to garner two greatest-hits packages (the formerwas on another label), the baritone-rich Tracy Byrd hasn't been able to shake his lightweight status, mostly because his forte is danceable novelty songs, as with \"The Truth About Men,\" and estrogen-stirring ballads (\"Just Let Me Be in Love\"). Both of those tunes appear here, one right after the other, as if to show the dual side of the handsome Texan's personality. If the former reinforces the stereotype of men as football- and sex-obsessed goons, the Latin-flavored \"...Love\" presents the ideal male as a true-hearted romantic who lives for pheromone highs. Byrd is equally adept at embodying both extremes, but he's even better when he goes outside these roles with songs likeKeith Stegall's \"Tiny Town,\" which lets him wax nostalgic about something real. This second greatest-hits package contains new--if less fetchingly recorded versions--of \"Watermelon Crawl\" and \"I'm from the Country,\" as well as two brand-new songs. \"Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman,\" already a single, plants Byrd squarely back in cartoon territory, while the rockin' \"Johnny Cash\" proves to be less about the Man in Black than the saga of a hot-headed prole feeling his oats. Still, the latter is another step outside the box, something Byrd desperately needs to push for more often.--Alanna Nash", "title": "Greatest Hits"}

{"title": "Greatest Hits", "description": "Greatest Hits chronicles the remarkable journey of Mr Robert Williams, from being the \"fat dancer from Take That\" (c. Noel Gallagher) to the multi-million pound jewel in EMI&#x92;s crown. Assembled in chronological order, all the hits are here, except for his initial solo outing \"Freedom\", and it&#x92;s interesting to see how his sound evolves from wannabe Britpop buffoon on the sub-Oasis pubrock of \"Old Before I Die\" to the subtle captivating melodies of \"Feel\" and \"Come Undone\". There are so many great tracks that it&#x92;s impossible to list them all, but highlights have to be the barnstorming \"Let Me Entertain You\", the bouncy, floor-filling \"Rock DJ\" and the song that madeth the man, \"Angels\". The two latest additions to his canon--\"Radio\" and \"Misunderstood\" clearly have one eye on the past, the other on the future &#x96; with the latter an instant classic Robbie ballad from the Bridget Jones 2 soundtrack and the former a foray into the world of electro pop that sounds like a warped Human League track from the 1980s.

{"description": "Heart is another hard rocking band whose career falls into two categories, Before The Fall and After The Fall. The rock-as-act-of-seduction &quot;Crazy on You,&quot; was a powerhouse with its acoustic intro that eventually led to an orgiastic vocal crescendo, thanks to Ann Wilson's throaty pipes. &quot;Magic Man&quot; was their entry into the 1970s-rock-opus category, with its epic guitar and synth solos. The ballsy &quot;Barricuda&quot; and the lilting &quot;Dog and Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; showed the band could deliver the goods, regardless of tempo or volume. Then came The Fall, a several-year long period when the Wilson sisters couldn't get a hit if they had targets painted on their backs. Heart eventually pulled it back together with power rock ballads, including &quot;What About Love&quot; and &quot;These Dreams.&quot; The band continued in this vein through the rest of the 1980s, turning in the occasional rocker like &quot;Never.&quot; Overall,These Dreams--Heart's Greatest Hitsis a fine sampling of the band's career. Particularly interesting is the acoustic version of &quot;Straight On,&quot; which--in its original form--had the band convincingly flexing some funk muscle. --Steve Gdula", "title": "Greatest Hits"}
{"description": "He's sold millions of albums, filled arenas, and hobnobbed with George Harrison, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison, but Tom Petty's driving heartland rock has often been taken for granted by the same critics who hail John Mellencamp as a genius.Greatest Hitsis an airtight argument for Petty's own greatness.  Starting with &quot;American Girl,&quot; the rollicking, Byrds-inspired single from Petty's first album in 1976, this compilation presents a chronological overview of the guitarist-vocalist's career with and without the Heartbreakers, also chronically underrated as one of today's best bands. Every one of the 16 older tracks is a well-crafted gem, full of solid guitar hooks (&quot;Here Comes My Girl&quot;), arresting images (&quot;Don't Come Around Here No More&quot;) and simple but poetic lyrics (&quot;The Waiting&quot;).Petty isn't an innovator; he's a talented craftsman with impeccable taste and a strong sense of rock history, internalizing influences ranging from the Beatles' psychedelic masterpiece,Revolver, to the best of '70s punk. (It's interesting to remember that early efforts such as &quot;Refugee&quot; and &quot;Don't Do Me Like That&quot; first won Petty attention as a New Wave artist). With his Dylanesque vocals and chiming 12-string guitars, Petty is more often linked these days with the sounds of the '60s.

{"description": "If time is the true test, then Guns N' Roses'Greatest Hitsconfirms that they really were one of the greatest rock & roll bands in the world. While, in retrospect, fellow graduates of the class of 1987 are about as cool as poodle perms and spandex, the L.A. bad boys still rock like gods. Listening to the sun-drenched chords of \"Paradise City\" and the ensuing stadium-sized swagger is enough to make wearing leather trousers and bandanas seem like a good idea. Of course, it helped that for them sex, drugs, and rock & roll was a way of life, not a fashion statement.

Yet equally, it was his surprisingly poetic nature that made genuinely touching love songs of \"Patience\" and \"Sweet Child of Mine.\"Though none of their subsequent albums matched the drug-crazed genius ofAppetite for Destruction, they did, as theGreatest Hitsreminds, have their moments. From the bloatedUse Your Illusion I&IIcame ultimate rock ballads \"Don't Cry\" and \"November Rain,\" along with the primal rage that was \"You Could Be Mine.\" And while the covers of theThe Spaghetti Incident?were largely forgettable, the fact that their final single was a seedy sneer through theRolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" seems spectacularly fitting. --Dan Gennoe", "title": "Greatest Hits"}

Singer Allan Clarke was one of the most versatile vocalists of the British Invasion, able to pull off cute pop vignettes (\"Bus Stop\"), whoop it up like the original rockabilly (\"Long Cool Woman\"), lament majestically (\"King Midas in Reverse\"), and add distinctive blues colorings to the band's R&B; covers (\"Just One Look\").

{"description": "Johnny Cash once called him \"my favorite songwriter,\" and Waylon Jennings recorded nearly an entire album (Honky Tonk Heroes) of his material in 1973--lots of folks insist that was the first true \"outlaw\" record. Billy Joe Shaver, whose \"Old Chunk of Coal,\" \"Georgia on a Fast Train,\" and \"Old Five and Dimers\" rank as standards of Texas singer-songwriter lore, is closer to his 70th birthday than his 60th, but he still burns it down on stage, and he still lives the soulful, close-to-the-bone life of his impoverished, raggedy-ass youth. These days, it would be easy for the five-time Grammy nominee to lean on his woeful personal story--growing up picking cotton and dropping out of school in the eighth grade, then losing his wife, mother, and guitarist son, Eddy, in a matter of months at the turn of the millennium. Instead, he continues to challenge himself in his writing. This collection of his best-loved songs (it's erroneous to call them \"hits\") contains a driving live rendition of \"Georgia\" and two new offerings (the remarkable love song \"Light a Candle for Me\" and the tongue-in-cheek \"Melody\") as well as some lubricated on-stage preaching and storytelling. (It also reprises his unfortunate duet with Big &amp; Rich on \"Live Forever\"... but let's pretend that never happened.) Shaver's singing remains an acquired taste, rivaling a rusty barn-door latch rattling in the wind. Yet in the age of Pro-Tooled prettiness, authenticity never sounded more welcome.--Alanna Nash", "title": "Greatest Hits"}

{"description": "Many greatest hits packages are a nifty way of making a quick  buck off of fans' devotion, so let's put this particular offering in  perspective. First off, ex-New Editionfrontman Bobby Brown put out one certified fabulous record, 1988's  landmarkDon't Be Cruel.  After that he released a few OK singles (most notably \"On Our Own,\"  which is included in this collection). His songs produced prior to 1988 (with the exception, of course, of his years with New Edition) were  decent but strictly mainstream. Nothing compared to Brown and Teddy  Riley's \"new jack swing,\" the beat of the 80's. With that caveat, if  you absolutely need to hear \"Humping Around\" or Bobby's duet with wifeyWhitney Houston, \"Something In Common,\" then by all means buy this. Yet smart money  would suggest that perhaps just buyingDon't Be Crueland  digging the sublime \"Every Little Step\" again would not only be more  cost-effective, but also easier on the ears.--Amy Linden", "title": "Greatest Hits"}
{"description": "More prolific thanD'AngeloandTerence Trent D'Arbycombined, one-man rock & soul revivalist Lenny Kravitz kept traditional pop values alive through much of the '90s. From the Motown-perfect \"It Ain't Over Til It's Over\" to the Beatlesesque \"Let Love Rule,\" Kravitz has always inhabited his influences with a genuine spirit that transcends imitation. The 15 tracks found here provide a surprisingly coherent reminder of just how much the artist has accomplished in a relatively short time. And even if his biggest hit, \"Are You Gonna Go My Way,\" falls short of itsHendrixtarget, Kravitz's cover of theGuess Who's \"American Woman\" still rocks in a pleasingly Neanderthal way. An infectious new cut, \"Again,\" fits neatly alongside sturdy Kravitz originals such as \"Fly Away,\" \"Mr. Cab Driver,\" and \"Black Velveteen,\" showcasing a talent whose postmodern pop should play well into the new century.--Bill Forman", "title": "Greatest Hits"}

{"title": "Greatest Hits", "description": "Night Ranger's career was certainly buttressed by MTV, which made the San Francisco Bay Area group a video staple in the early '80s. &quot;Don't Tell Me You Love Me&quot; stands as a fine piece of '80s hair metal, with bassist Jack Blades chunk-a-chunking his pickups to create that rock-locomotive sound. The band slows things down with &quot;Sister Christian,&quot; a not-so-powerful power ballad that gave Night Ranger another significant single. Packaging a select portion of their catalog under theGreatest Hitsbanner is a bit of a stretch, though. Blades didn't even stick around for long, breaking away to join former Styx guitarist Tommy Shaw and Ted Nugent in Damn Yankees.

{"title": "Greatest Hits", "description": "One question would be: What took him so long? After all, a contemporary likeVan Morrisonhas sold boatloads of his single-discbest-ofset to buyers wary of diving into that deep catalog without a primer to get them started. So three and a half decades into his solo career, Neil Young finally delivers his version of that most modest of albums--the pre-holiday \"hits\" overview. What's surprising, coming from such a proud maverick, is its conventionality. Granted, the original master mixes are a boon for fans, but otherwise, there's not much here for loyalists who quite likely already possess the original \"Like a Hurricane\" on a couple of albums, as well as a handful of live interpretations scanning the years. Since Young cracked the Top 10 only once (1972's \"Heart of Gold\"), this set is built around concert staples as \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Rockin' in the Free World,\" and \"Hey, Hey, My My\" rather than chart favorites. Despite Young's honorable standing as a still-vital graybeard, the disc is skewed heavily toward his early work, shortchanging some mighty productive recent years. Peripheral fans may find this set of interest, but faithful followers are better advised to investigate theDVD version, which, at least, includes videos, photos, lyrics, and Web links.--Steven Stolder"}

The resulting music was sometimes ironically reactionary, if nothing else, embracing the more direct musical essence of the '50s and '60s. But few took the notion to the extremes of Stray CatsBrian Setzer,Lee Rocker, and Slim Jim Phantom, the most popular rockabilly revival band to ever emerge from, of all places, Long Island. This set documents the Cats' brief heyday and its faithful aping ofCarl Perkins,Eddie Cochran, andGene Vincent. And if his vocal chops sometimes didn't match the quality of his fiery, often inspired guitar licks, musical evangelist Setzer made up for his shortcomings with sheer exuberant devotion to the genre and its godfathers. The hits are all here, along with some revealing album cuts, rarities, and portions of a 1982 live broadcast that display the Cats' considerable live charms. And if this set makes you yearn for some real original '50s rockabilly, nothing would make Setzer and company happier.Jerry McCulley"}

As his reputation reached the West, he attracted a coterie of admiring pop stars and graced such film soundtracks asThe Last Temptation of ChristandDead Man Walking. So many of his recordings are still in print that a curious beginner might well wonder where to start, but these four tracks (qawwali is often sung for a half-hour without stopping) are a perfect introduction to the works of an incomparable, much-missed musical genius.--Christina Roden"}

{"description": "With a sad tenor that sounded like Mr. Haney fromGreen Acres, Tim McGraw, a freshman in country's crowded class of '92, seemed the least likely to graduate to superstardom. But eight years and 20 million albums and singles later, here he is with a greatest hits package so stuffed with songs--15 in all--that it doesn't have room for any new tunes, or even the best of all, \"Everywhere.\" McGraw's appeal is two-fold: Aside from his unlistenable duets with wifeFaith Hilland the abysmal \"Indian Outlaw\" that jump-started his career, he's had excellent taste in songs. And he's the epitome of the average guy in search of extraordinary love--the loser who becomes a winner.

{"title": "Heaven", "description": "As in her Gone from Home (reviewed above), Johnson here explores the themes of what makes a place home and which people family. Fourteen-year-old Marley's tranquil life in Heaven, Ohio, turns hellish the day her family receives a letter from Alabama. The note (from the pastor of a church that was destroyed by arson) requests a replacement for Marley's baptismal record, and reveals that \"Momma\" and \"Pops\" are really Marley's aunt and uncle, and mysterious Jack (an alleged \"uncle\" with whom Marley has corresponded but doesn't remember) is her true father. In this montage of Marley's changing perceptions, Johnson presents fragments of the whole picture a little at a time: images of people, places (the Western Union building \"1637\" steps away from Marley's house) and artifacts (a box filled with love letters between her birth parents) gain significance as Marley begins to make sense of the past and integrate her perceptions into her new identity. The author's poetic metaphors describe a child grasping desperately for a hold on her reality (\"It was one of those nights that started to go down before the sun did,\" she says of the evening the fateful letter arrives). The melding of flashbacks and present-day story line may be confusing initially, but readers who follow Marley's winding path toward revelation will be well rewarded.

Christie Murphy has only one thing in mind: get her two children back home, to their fortified house on Staten Island. The book is a neat twist on the zombie theme, and the story moves at a brisk clip, with plenty of mayhem. But it reads like a screenplay in prose form. Paragraphs are extremely short, dialogue is brief and rarely consists of more than a few sentences, and character development takes a backseat to action. The Can Heads themselves are only superficially explored, except for a few tantalizing hints that will, presumably, be explored in the next book.

Most surprising are Grant's two contributions (cowritten with Chris Eaton and Robert Marshal, respectively,) \"Breath of Heaven/Mary's Song\" and the powerful and humbling \"Emmanuel, God with Us.\" Exquisitely produced and arranged,Home for Christmasis a highly rewarding mainstream Christmas masterpiece without flaw or pretense.--Martin Keller", "title": "Home for Christmas"}

Petey Pat Kane and Mariana Pelligrino have loved each other since the first grade, but a tragic prom night accident sends Kane running. He ends up a grunt in Iraq, where he's killed&mdash;briefly&mdash;by a suicide bomber. While dead, he goes on a spiritual journey, meets God and learns that he is destined to be Mariana's lover and protector. Back among the living, stubborn Petey's reminded by his local priest what's really important in life.

Blessed with one of our generation's prettiest  soubrette voices, Battle breezes through the technical challenges of theCountess and Constanze,but sounds like a little girl trying on Mommy's  shoes. She lacks the vocal variety and depth to successfully bring these pieces  to life. Her renditions of the soubrette repertory, especially \"Ruhe sanft,\" are  Mozartfully graceful.

When the band kicks in for the title poem of that first LP, a flood of reggae tension bursts forth. And it just keeps coming. This double set is the only live recording of one of reggae's finest intelligences, and it's a killer. Linton Kwesi Johnson (a.k.a. LKJ) reveals his scholarly bent in \"Intro,\" his brief greeting to the audience, describing the concert as a reflection of his poetic progress, and modestly stating that after 11 years in the biz, he's still an apprentice. But that's the sole quiet moment. The Dub Band, justly famed for drawing the sounds of the black diaspora into an airtight reggae celebration, is an awesome musical beast here.

{"title": "In Concert", "description": "Today's popular music has reduced it to a kind of subgenre--sometimes singled out by the label \"unplugged,\" as if it were like taking to a cabin with no running water for a week--but the practice of \"a cappella\" vocalism (i.e., voices alone without accompaniment) is the heart and soul of singing. Natural as it seems to the ear, it's true virtuosity that enables the vocal quintetRockapellato hold audiences spellbound. Ever since their street-performing days in late-1980s Manhattan, the group has evolved a style of sweet close harmonies and acoustical illusions all the more impressive for the effortlessness with which they carry it off. That \"second-nature\" quality of sounding so natural frees Rockapella up to work their charms before an audience, as they do in this recording of a concert given to an enthusiastic crowd in Santa Barbara, California, in December 2000 (also available as aDVD release). The program includes many songs bearing Rockapella'ssignature stamp, such as \"Zombie Jamboree,\" \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight,\" \"Pretty Woman,\" and of course their theme number \"Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?\"--which calls for a classic workout of Jeff Thacher's jaw-dropping (if you will) vocal percussion. There are also examples of the group's devout balladry, such as their cover of \"A Change in My Life.\" It's amusing to observe the effects of individual members--Barry Carl's benthic bass, for example--as they work the crowd. From street-corner barbershop to Carnegie Hall, Rockapella define singing into a variation of breathing, with a flow that's natural and organic.--Thomas May"}

Fortunately, Yearwood loosens up with the playful bite ofMatraca Berg's \"For a While\" providing material worth sinking her teeth into, while vocal support fromVince Gill(\"I Don't Paint Myself into Corners\") andBuddy Miller(\"Love Let Go\") complements her subtle soulfulness.

But as Karly goes off to school, she loses Natasha in all of the hustle and bustle of the classroom. Karly is a solitary child, and when other children begin to make fun of her reticence, she comes home feeling alone and blue. Luckily for her, Natasha is there to remind her about loving herself. They decide that Karly should live \"inside out\"-letting the people around her see who she is in her spirit, and that she will wear her socks inside out as a reminder. The text is preachy, and the story gets bogged down in the sheer number of messages. Not only does Natasha act as an invisible friend, but she also discusses Karly's soul and what happened to the child before she was born. Likewise, the illustrations get bogged down in the amount of details included within them. There are whirls of action that mimic the spirit of Natasha, causing her to be lost in the midst of them. As well, the most important action in several pictures is lost in the gutter. Overall, this book will be useful only in schools that have strong character-education components or in religious classrooms.Susan Marie Pitard, formerly at Weezie Library for Children, Nantucket Atheneum, MACopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"title": "Jade Harmony Professional 3/16-Inch Yoga Mat", "description": "Jade Yoga's most popular premium mat, the Jade Harmony Professional 3/16-inch mat offers a perfect balance of traction and cushion. Jade mats are made with open-cell, natural rubber, which is well known for offering terrific slip-resistance. As a result, you no longer have to worry about slipping on your practice mat--even if it gets wet with perspiration. Jade mats also offer exceptional resilience, unmatched compression-set resistance, and incomparable cushioning, so you'll stay comfortable with every pose. And because natural rubber is a renewable resource tapped from rubber trees, the company's mats contain no PVC or ozone-depleting substances. Jade mats--which are made in the U.S. in compliance with all U.S. environmental and labor laws--are perfect for the yogi concerned about the Earth. Jade Yoga also plants a tree for every mat sold in partnership with Trees for the Future.The Harmony Professional comes in 68- and 74-inch lengths and is available in a variety of colors. The Jade can be hand washed with mild soap and warm water, and then hung or laid flat to dry out of direct sunlight.About Jade YogaIn a way, Jade Yoga began long before launching its first purple and blue Harmony yoga mats in 2002. Jade Yoga grew out of Jade Industries, a company that had been making non-slip natural rubber rug pads for area rugs since the early 1970s. For many years, Jade Industries also sold rug pads to select yogis in the area for use as yoga mats. As the story goes, rug mats first attracted the attention of yogis after B.K.S. Iyengar--who was in the U.S. doing a yoga demonstration on an oriental rug--asked a student to remove the rug after slipping repeatedly. Under the rug sat a rug mat, and the first yoga mat was born. Unfortunately, most yoga companies started making mats of cheap, imitation plastic or PVC instead--annoyingly slippery surfaces that were close to useless for many practices. Jade Yoga began in earnest in 2000 after it was approached by a savvy yogi who described the problem with these plastic and PVC mats. As Jade Industries were already making natural rubber rug pads, the company approached the problem from that angle and developed the Harmony, the first natural rubber yoga mat. Located in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, Jade Yoga has a number of products in the pipeline that align with the company's vision of producing high-quality products in an  way."}

{"description": "Commentaire Anglais \"This Mexican band can be noticed by its quality and numerous production. Despite its unexpected sudden appearance, CAST possesses all the components to create a very good and symphonic Progressive rock. The vocals are well placed, full of emotion, evoking John WETTON, the instrumental parts are energetic and intelligent, the compositions are ambitious and the rhythms can be placed on the same level as GENTLE GIANT. Also, the melodies are powerful and full of energy. The band plays a highly elaborated Progressive rock, melodious and virtuoso at the same time. The complex writing blends with superb combinations on keyboards and guitar. The strong and elaborated melodies evoke HAPPY THE MAN, ECHOLYN and the US Progressive school, with a hint of YES, Steve HACKETT and GENESIS, or even PREMIATA FORNERIA MARCONI In the more lyrical and airy pieces. On \"\"A Live Record\"\", CAST performs a melodious and elegant music in the style of CAMEL, GENESIS or IQ, with a symphonic dimension mainly coming from the keyboards. This live album gives the possibility to hear their best titles recorded between 1995 and 1998. \"\"Imaginary Windows\"\" is their latest record. As in the former albums, they perform perfectly buit compositions, that don't leave aside their usual lyricism and that are noticeable because of their suggestive vocals and instrumental density that mixes guitar, keyboards (Piano, synthesizers) and an airy flute.

{"description": "Guy Davis started his performing career as an actor--he was Dr. Josh Hall onOne Life to Livein the 1980s and he playedRobert Johnsonin the off-Broadway playTrick the Devil--and his first recordings, while quite good, sometimes sounded as if he were just playing the role of a bluesman. OnLegacy, Davis's seventh CD, his honey-and-gravel voice has mellowed, his intricate guitar picking has sharpened, and all traces of his earlier staginess have gone. When he playsMississippi John Hurt's \"Pay Day\" orLightnin' Hopkins's \"Come Back Baby\" he brings an authority to the music that only comes from deep understanding. And his own songs, such as the moody and moving \"I Just Can't Help Loving You\" or the jittery, banjo-driven  \"Red Goose,\" show that he has assimilated the old styles and has found a way to bring them into the modern world without sounding like a mere imitator. OnLegacy, Guy Davis serves notice that he isn't merely acting as a bluesman, but that he is emerging as the genuine article.--Michael John Simmons", "title": "Legacy"}
{"description": "Hard science and human interest intersect ingeniously in this prequel to Bear's Eon (1987) and Eternity (1988). Twenty-five years after the opening of The Way, a kind of tunnel through space that permits access to different planets and time continua, Olmy Ap Sennon is sent through it to spy on 4000 \"divaricates\" who fled the starship Thistledown for a utopian existence on the sylvan world of Lamarckia. What he finds, instead, is a full-blown divaricate civil war, whose opposing sides mirror his own ambivalent feelings about life aboard the strictly regimented starship. Olmy and the divaricates work through their respective identity crises against the exuberantly imagined backdrop of Lamarckia, a planet whose integrated ecosystem adapts readily to change. While occasionally numbing in their detail, Bear's meticulous descriptions of flora and fauna serve an important function: they authenticate Lamarckia as a world that assimilates and learns from other organisms, making it the perfect crucible for examining the personal and political dramas staged within it. This is a stunning SF novel that extrapolates a scientifically complex future from the basic stuff of human nature.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Legacy"}

{"description": "Kay's prodigious research buttresses this robust historical romance, winner of Britain's Georgette Heyer Historical Novel Prize and the Betty Trask Prize for a first novel. England's greatest Queen is presented from an intriguing psychological viewpointElizabeth I's need for men and the bondage endured by those she chose. Freely mixing the verifiable with the imagined, Kay traces Elizabeth's rise from lonely childhood to lonely eminence. In the person of Robert Dudley, later Leicester, she creates a romantic fulcrum for Elizabeth's womanliness, delineating the childhood affection for Dudley that flowered in clandestine liaison and may be the closest Elizabeth came to a loving relationship. All of the Court's intriguing personnelfrom the ubiquitous, conniving Cecils to the presumptive upstart, Essexare drawn with care; the turbulence of the period, filled with violent deaths, challenges from abroad, pragmatic liaisons, is conveyed with verisimilitude; the rich tapesty of the Tudor ascendancy is woven with colorful threads.

{"title": "Legacy", "description": "Madball - a pummeling staple of New York Hardcore since the band&#x92;s inception in 1988 &#x96; is one of the few groups that can lay claim to achieving high marks in regards to all of the above, while also maintaining an undying spirit that, to many, represents the heart of what hardcore is all about.   Originally coming to fruition as an Agnostic Front side-project, featuring a junior-high aged Freddy Cricien &#x96; younger brother of legendary Agnostic Front frontman Roger Miret - on vocals, Madball quickly established a reputation as being one of the hardest-working and most visceral hardcore bands in the scene, which still holds true to this day.  In fact, Madball has shared the stage with nearly every reputable hardcore and metal band of the past decade, and even after years of existence the band can still outperform most of its contemporaries.  In celebration of the group&#x92;s 15 plus years of influential existence, Madball recently inked a deal with Ferret Records and with it comes the band&#x92;s most ambitious release to date, the aptly titled Legacy.  Produced by renowned heavy-music specialist Zeuss (Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Throwdown), Legacy is a continuation of all of the standards that any fan could expect from the group:  bruising rhythms and riffs, commanding vocals and an overall confidence that most hardcore troupes couldn&#x92;t touch with a ten-foot pole.   \"It&#x92;s like our last record, Hold it Down, times ten!\" longtime bassist Hoya beams.  \"We&#x92;re definitely stepping up our sound, but we&#x92;re still a hardcore band.  It&#x92;s not like we&#x92;re a jazz-fusion group or anything.  We do what we want to do--the sound is up to date, but we never base what we do on any kind of trend.  I think we&#x92;re a band that can hang with anybody.  We&#x92;re representing New York hardcore and heavy music all around.\"    While Legacy is reminiscent of the best of Madball&#x92;s past material, the sound of the new record also finds the group expanding its horizons a bit. One of the stand-out points of Legacy is its simple yet effective title, which touches upon a profound theme throughout the history of the band in more ways than one. \"Legacy means a lot of things to us,\" the enigmatic Cricien states.  \"A lot of the bands we grew up listening to passed on their legacy through hardcore.  We feel like we&#x92;re doing the same thing&#x97;we&#x92;re carrying on the legacy of hardcore, but we&#x92;re also passing it down to the younger kids.  This is definitely something that has played a big role in our lives.\"\"I want to continue to take the band to another level,\" Cricien says with excitement in his deep voice.  \"I want to knock down the borders but still represent what the core of what Madball has always been.  We still feel as strongly about Madball as we ever have.\""}
{"title": "Legacy", "description": "Rick Nelson's lengthy career spanned 30 years, with records on the  charts from the late '50s to the early '80s, yet most remember him only as  \"Little Ricky.\" This comprehensive, 100-song retrospective rectifies that,  giving full scope to his remarkable and surprisingly robust career.  Additionally, the photo-heavy booklet gives insight into the era when rock &  roll, television, and culture first merged. Ricky Nelson was the first teen  idol who grew up on television. His parents'Ozzie and Harriet Showafforded him the opportunity to sing, and he was groomed to be early TV's middle  ground between Elvis and Pat Boone. Disc 1 captures this period, featuring his  earliest hits such as \"I'm Walkin'\" and \"Poor Little Fool,\" though others likeLittle Walter's \"My Babe\" and \"There Goes My Baby\", with sizzling guitar leads by James Burton, reveal a genuine rockabilly edginess, suggesting Ricky's truer leanings.Disc 2 has the majority of Ricky's largest hits, pop pieces from '59 to '65, where the addition of strings and theJordanaires' backing vocals led to smash hits like \"Mary Lou,\" \"Travelin' Man,\" and \"Young World.\"Disc 3 documents Rick's (he had dropped they) mid-'60s evolution into a country sound heavily influenced byBob Dylan'sNashville Skyline. Rick's version of Dylan's \"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\" was well received, but the big hit on this disc is \"Garden Party,\" a wry, autobiographical take on his rejection by a '72 oldies-oriented crowd at Madison Square Garden.Disc 4 features material with his Stone Canyon Band, covering the period from 1972 to 1985, the year of his unfortunate plane crash. By now, his rich, yearning voice blends perfectly with the pedal-steel-led band, and the music sounds remarkably contemporary.Rick Nelson's teenage celebrity typecast him for life, butLegacyreveals a solid musician who matured and grew over time. This anthology does him and his fans a great service.--Wally Shoup"}

Despite his lineage, Lane hadn't decided to become a professional musician until he heard Jimi Hendrix's \"Hey Joe,\" after which he put down his jackhammer and picked up his axe. Influenced not only by Hendrix, but also byAlbert King,Albert Collins,andStevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy D. has a power rock groove to go with his deeper, darker, bluesier groove that's showcased here on \"Four O'Clock in the Morning\" and Howlin' Wolf's powerful \"Big House.\"--Alan Greenberg"}
{"title": "Legacy", "description": "This album is among the last recordings made before Jimmy Smith died early in 2005. The 79 year old master of the Hammond B-3 organ was brought in by DeFrancesco, more than forty years his junior and responsible for continuing and expanding upon the instrument's place in the jazz tradition. The pair had recorded a live set previously (Incredible!, released in 2000), but with this set DeFrancesco wanted to create a studio album that would celebrate Smith's strengths within a sympathetic setting. The younger organist plays piano on a number of the tracks, but more than half of the disc is devoted to dual Hammond performances. It's a mark of their skills, and the warmth and clarity of the recording, that each of their organs is identifiable throughout.--David Greenberger"}

His tone is warm and resonant, his phrasing unfussy, and his harmonic finesse allows him to effortlessly bridge R&B; and jazz traditions. Newman's consistency as a bandleader on HighNote is remarkable and this is yet another session that proves the point. This time out David has selected a program that remembers his friend and colleague John Hicks. Besides the title tune, penned by Hicks, David offers eight standards that feature his alto, tenor and flute playing with the added color of Steve Nelson's vibes. This intimate setting is well suited to Newman's deep-toned balladry, as well as allowing plenty of elbow room for him to swing out when the spirit moves him.", "title": "Life"}

{"description": "Ricky Martin'sself-titled1999 album made him an international crossover star, and it's been both a blessing and a curse ever since. The Puerto Rican heartthrob became the poster boy for the much-ballyhoed Latin-pop movement, and he paved the way for English-language albums from Paulina Rubio, Thalia and Shakira. At the same time, Martin's processed pop recordings quickly lost favor at radio, and he seemed destined to become a musical footnote.Lifefinds the charismatic singer exuding a newfound confidence and showcasing some much-needed musical diversity. Martin traveled to India to record the string arrangements for the album, and that influence is felt throughout the disc's 12 tracks. Middle Eastern accents embellish tracks \"Til I Get To You\" and \"I Won't Desert You,\" and groovy first single \"I Don't Care\" adds guest vocals from Fat Joe and soulful songbird Amerie for some street cred. Vocally, Martin sounds better than ever; he pushes his modest voice past its normal limit to match the intensity of the music. And like any good pop icon looking to maximize airplay, Martin dabbles in reggaeton during \"Drop it On Me\" and the Luny Tunes Mix of \"Que Mas Da (I Don't Care).\"Lifemay be the sound of an artist still looking for his individual sound, but it's a pretty enjoyable ride nonetheless.--Joey Guerra", "title": "Life"}

While the New York-based sextet fits  loosely into the nu metal category, Dope take more from basic rock & roll  structures and less from faux-aggro rap-rock than many of their brethren. In  fact, the catchy first single, \"Now or Never,\" boasts an almost classic-rock  vibe, and the entire record is more rock and less \"shock\" than their decent  debut,Felons and  Revolutionaries. Though at times Edsel has aMarilyn Mansoninflection to his voice, and on songs like \"Stop\" there are hints ofWhite Zombie-influenced  electronic riff-rock, the melody lines and vocals make most ofLife's  songs timeless and accessible, while still maintaining a dark, angry and Gen-Y- leaning appeal. Many ofLife's 13 cuts, including \"What About\" and  \"Slipping Away\" are basic, dramatic, and cool, Dope proving themselves no slaves  to rock/metal fashion while still existing within their modern musical milieu.--Katherine Turman", "title": "Life"}
{"title": "Life", "description": "These days it's getting harder to tell the real pop twerps from the hip parodists--both of whom make music sweeter and more dizzying than cherry wine. Take Sweden's Cardigans, for example: On one hand, they work the same delicious Bacharach lounge jazz and gooey '60s girl swoons as Pizzicato Five, a group whose retrokitsch is delivered with a big, fake-eyelashed wink. On the other hand, the Cardigans come from a land that gave us Abba and Ace of Base, sincere pop legends if ever there were. The Cardigans, it seems, could go either way, and their subtle blend of pop-for-pop's-sake with pop-for-joke's-sake makes their first American release,Life, all the more a modernist gem.There's no use digging below the surface ofLife's amazingly catchy opening quartet of tunes. All the joy to be extracted lies right on the surface: &quot;Carnival&quot;'s loopy organ and punchy beat is all cotton candy and merry-go-rounds; &quot;Daddy's Car&quot; is a fun-fun-fun ride to the up-up-and-away; &quot;Fine&quot; soars heavenward while &quot;Rise & Shine&quot; is mile-a-minute perk-me-up. From there, though, &quot;Our Space&quot; ventures deeper, into darker and moodier atmospherics and a trip-hoppy electronic shuffle. Singer Nina Persson's crystalline lullaby voice keeps it all sounding innocent as hell, but when she sinks her candy-coated teeth into a Black Sabbath cover (&quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;) she exposes a few sinister cavities. By the time she closes the album, exulting &quot;No one can be happier than me!&quot; the effect is eerie enough for David Lynch. WithLife, the Cardigans give us pop till it hurts.--Roni Sarig"}
{"description": "This is full-frontal Ginuwine.The Lifehas 15 crisp and  clean tracks, three ballads, two mercifully brief interludes, and,  praises be, onlyoneguest appearance. With the exception of one  or two tracks, the album's subject matter crystallizes Ginuwine's shiny  digitized persona: the iced-out, ghetto-down-yet-sensitive, pretty-boy  player with a pocket full of money. As a flesh-and-blood artist,  Ginuwine is a reasonably talented, trend-conscious love man with the  ability to turn fairly ordinary songs about two-way pagers, g-strings,  and the myriad pressures of being a hard-working sex symbol intoBillboard-bound hits. Even though he focuses on adult topics,  Ginuwine's songs seem to center around the type of fantasies  15-year-olds indulge in while watching MTV on a school night. Five of these  tracks are up-tempo rump shakers and 10 are turbo-charged,  up-on-the-downstroke slow jams. The party songs are cluttered with drum and bass,  whistles, mediocre Spanish guitars, and other gimmicks that merely  distract from Ginuwine's capable midrange vocals. Stick with the slick  slow jams, and he might just get your heart racing.--Rebecca  Levine", "title": "Life"}
{"description": "Though Sly & the Family Stone wouldn't score a hit until their third album,Dance to the Music, the roots of the group's revolutionary mix of classic R&B; with San Francisco's burgeoning acid-rock sound can be heard loud and clear on their second album, 1968'sLife. With no clear standout tracks,Lifeis fascinating more for its explorations than its arrivals. The elements are all there--the dynamic ensemble singing, the adventurous arrangements, the hard funk beats, the screaming guitars--butLifeis a musical vision not yet fully formed. When it finally did come together, nothing would be the same again.--Roni Sarig", "title": "Life"}
{"description": "What a difference a decade can make: the original 1995 reissue ofLife, Sly and the Family Stone's too-often-overlooked third album, would've triggered few associations beyond the singer's fans (and those who love killer soul-rock hybrids). In 2007, though, the opening shot of \"Into My Own Thing\" blares as the framework for Fatboy Slim's \"Weapon of Choice,\" a rising, organ-and-horn melody statement with a taut, snare-drum thwack as its spine. Then Sly and the Family are off, talking about meditation and a big, bright 1968 vibe they ushered the prior year before withDance to the Music. The tune titles tell a story: \"Chicken,\" \"Love City,\" \"Fun,\" and the sheer musical cheer of \"Harmony,\" the playful tuba and organ of \"Life,\" even the opening fuzz-guitar grit of \"Dynamite!\"--these makeLifetransitional, a bridge from Sly's hard-hitting funk riffage to more rock, more pop. The album flopped commercially in 1968--the psych-funk of \"Plastic Jim\" and its \"Eleanor Rigby\"-inspired refrain \"All the plastic people / What do they all come for\" superseded quickly by the release later in the year of the brawnier, peppier \"Everyday People.\" That latter tune launched the band's 1969 fourth album,Stand!, to significantly new commercial heights (and larger narcotic appetites).

{"description": "Grade 1-4&ndash;A small pig creates an ingenious way to turn his light out at 8 p.m., as his parents require, but also to have the time he needs to settle into sleep before the room goes dark. His elaborate, Rube Goldbergian construction will have young readers poring over each page as a sequence of mechanical events unfolds. Only a few words introduce the story, but the visual narrative is lively and complex, showing the movement of each object in turn as the action runs up to the roof, down the walls, through the yard, into the basement, and so on. The porker sinks under the covers and his parents read calmly in the living room while the extraordinary machine does its work around the house. Readers will notice that the plans for this lights-out contraption are tacked up on the walls of the small pig's room, and that he's left some of his tools lying about&ndash;a wonderful and sweet attention to detail. Fans of roller-coaster construction, marble runs, and contraption-like machines will be immediately engaged, and the problem-solving humor is for everyone. The fine lines and small scale of Geisert's color art work perfectly to give an effect that is intimate, energetic, and delightful.&ndash;Kathie Meizner, Montgomery County Public Libraries, Chevy Chase, MDCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With millions in endorsements on the line, he's anxious to announce a wedding date with his high school sweetheart, Christina, hoping to counteract a statutory rape claim that's about to go public. But his fianc&eacute;e has been seeing former pitcher Ryan Rossetti, who blew out his arm and now works a dead-end job as a house painter. Insanely jealous of the \"J.T. fever\" sweeping the hood, the self-involved Ryan is determined to keep Christina for himself. Starr (Twisted City) is a master at portraying Brooklyn as a dark corner of hell (and even gives genre fans a taste of one of the sexual obsessions of past noir master David Goodis), but J.T and Ryan prove almost too unpleasant to take. When the ex-con Saiquan comes into play, riding along for some payback on a gang shooting, the plot jumps into overdrive and heads mercilessly for Starr's always bleak finish line.Author tour.

{"description": "The author of The Fury of Rachel Monette here creates a fascinating and memorable character in Eddie Nye, a young man who spends 15 years in jail for a crime he didn't commit. After he is finally released, Eddie quickly discovers that a strange meeting with an incarcerated drug kingpin on his last day in prison has somehow enmeshed him in an intricate and dangerous plot. Seeking out his older brother, a Wall Street \"investment consultant\" who deserted him while he was behind bars, Eddie uncovers a pattern of betrayal reaching all the way back to the day the Coast Guard arrested him on account of a cache of shipboard drugs he knew nothing about. Eddie, who became an avid reader while in jail and is particularly fascinated by \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" asks everyone he meets in the course of his suspenseful investigation why they think the old sailor killed the albatross and why he suffered so as a result--as with his own case, the punishment seems out of proportion to the crime in Eddie's eyes. A fateful decision to try and help his brother out of overwhelming financial troubles leads to the discovery of some awful secrets and to personal disaster for Eddie. Abrahams spares the reader nothing, in gritty dialogue and often gruesome detail.

His heroine is a sociable young mouse who encounters a number of friendly animals on her way to visit her ailing grandmother: a family of ducks, a chivalrous frog and a squirrel who stops to tell her the time. Who can blame her for assuming that the intentions of an impeccably dressed wolfsporting an ascot and top hatare innocent? Goodall's trademark use of alternating full and half pages work well to accentuate the drama of the story; in a few quick flips of the page the wolf springs from granny's door into her bedwith granny's red-stockinged feet dangling from his mouth. The woodcutter is a brawny bear who, despite the grisly appearance of blood on his axe, still has the appetite for a civilizing cup of tea after escorting Little Red Riding Hood home to her mother. Lush watercolor paintings beautifully evoke the woodland setting, balancing the more sinister elements of the story; this is another impressive addition to Goodall's distinctive opus.

The jacket, with windmills and Renaissance cathedral spires in the background, sets the scene and centers the heroine in a colorful outfit carrying a bountiful bouquet of flowers and wearing a white brimmed, vibrant red peaked hat tied snuggly under her chin. Grandmother, who is garbed in lace and flounces, and the hunters with their long rifles and Cavalier hats fit well into the setting. The wolf, when he appears, fills the page: he is large and ferocious, and dressed in an elaborate ruffled tunic, braided, wide-cuffed pants, and a broad-brimmed feathered hat. He's the Renaissance man personified, although his slathering tongue betrays his debonair look. Spirin places his characters up front on the page against plentiful white space, giving intensity to the unfolding drama.

{"description": "As much time as country artists spend out on the road--200 or more nights a year in most cases--you'd think they'd release a lot more live albums. Yet the whole idea of concert recordings seems to scare the pants off the control freaks at Nashville's record companies. Fortunately, a handful of country acts have dispensed with the conventional wisdom and released terrific live discs. Tracy Lawrence's--Liveis a fine example of what can happen when you put an exciting singer in front of an excitable audience.  At the baby-cheeked age of 27 and after just three studio albums, Lawrence has already racked up enough number-one and top-10 singles to justify a greatest-hits package. Instead of simply recycling those singles, he decided to rerecord them as a live album. The usual approach to making a live album is to pick one particular concert at random, tape the show and accept the results, good or bad. Instead, Lawrence built a portable studio in his tour bus, recording every show and having his musicians listen to the tapes so they could hear what was working and what wasn't. As a result, the band, nicknamed Little Elvis, refined the arrangements and eliminated the extra fuss and clutter which are the biggest sins of live music. The 10 songs on \"Live\" are taken from several concerts at the end of that process, and they boast a no-frills approach which allows the band to push Lawrence hard without getting in his way.--Geoffrey Himes", "title": "Live"}

{"title": "Live", "description": "Bill Frisell had been working regularly with bassist Kermit Driscoll and drummerJoey Baronfor five years when they recorded this concert in Spain in 1991. The familiarity shows in the spontaneity and in the intuitive grasp of every shifting musical gesture. The 70-minute performance may show Frisell's range and the ease with which he flows from one mood or genre to another better than any single studio CD. There's nothing contrived about the way a piece of Appalachian-inspired melody can sing with heightened clarity, only to transmute into fractured bits of electronic sound; nothing false in a Sonny Rollins bop tune, \"No Moe,\" taking on country-western and funk edges. It's Frisell's sheer involvement with his guitar and all the dimensions of music that comes through here, more than the strange ballet between common and arcane forms. He can immerse himself in forms from bop and free jazz to folk melodies and rock, slide from high modern pointillism to heavy-metal chord storms, or play his way from Baroque dance forms to surf guitar and spy-movie themes. The eerie bends and film noir ambience of the often-played \"Strange Meeting\" might serve as a symbol for the whole enterprise. There's hardly a musical border that doesn't get blurred here, but it's the feeling of a band enjoying what they're doing that comes through strongest, so that even the strangest and most subtle transitions come off with the naturalness and enthusiasm of a garage band.--Stuart Broomer"}

{"description": "In the 1990s the junction of jazz and funk has become quite a popular destination. Of course, soul-jazz was prominent among serious jazz cats throughout the 1960s and 1970s, but in the 1990s, the bug has spread to rock audiences who want extended jams and some space to dance. When it comes to blending danceable grooves with well-executed and thoughtful improvisation, San Diego's Greyboy Allstars are state-of-the-art, and as with most jam bands, the live stage is the true proving ground. Tenor sax playerKarl Densonis the one with the serious \"jazz cred\" and he proves it here in abundance, but the remaining four are as tight as your old bar-mitzvah suit. As a whole, the quintet tends toward a smoother, more melodic brand of funk, one with dollops of real \"soul music,\" making this live record a treat for both your brain and your behind.--Marc Greilsamer", "title": "Live"}

{"description": "Nobody plays rockin' blues with more heads-down authority than the current edition of the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Still led by singer-harmonica ace Kim Wilson, whose prowess on the instrument marks him as one of its all-time greats, the band surges through this February 2000 concert at full throttle. Which means the rhythm section keeps a flat-four chug percolating, pianist-organist Gene Taylor makes likeJohnny Johnsonon steroids, andKid Ramosdishes out rhythm 'n' leads with reverb-drenched efficiency, while Wilson keeps his pushy baritone thundering above it all.Ramos dives into the old T-Birds hit \"Tuff Enuff\" with a solo that punctuates steely riffing with funky chords. Wilson--although unremittingly powerful--sounds best on the slower numbers like Guitar Slim's \"The Things That I Used to Do\" (another Ramos showpiece) andJerry McCain's\"Tough Enough.\" The slower tempos allow him to wrap his voice around the lyrics, stretching syllables the same way his singing harp elongates and elaborates notes. The only gripe is that this concert's tight arrangements don't give Wilson enough time to solo. As his guest performances on Ronnie Earl's newRonnie Earl and Friends(Telarc) displays, the more Wilson stretches, the more inventive and melodic his playing becomes. And Wilson's solo return to the studio is overdue.--Ted Drozdowski", "title": "Live"}

The Prokofiev Sonata No. 6, one of Kissin's specialties since he was in his early teens, is very fluent and impressive, but it doesn't have the power the music needs for maximum impact. In fact, a lack of really powerful bass from the pianist's left hand (not a fault of the recording) lightens the weight of his playing throughout.

{"title": "Live at Carnegie Hall", "description": "The only applause not left edited out of this recording of Arcadi Volodos's Carnegie Hall debut recital--given on October&nbsp;21, 1998--comes after his house-burning encore of Liszt's maniacally florid variations (&agrave; la Horowitz) on the famous Mendelssohn \"Wedding March.\" But the volley of enthusiastic cheers and wallops that ensues is enough to register the charismatic spell this young Russian pianist must have cast over his audience. Only in his mid-20s, Volodos seems to channel a bygone era of the Russian variety of Romantic virtuosity in its dual aspect, from hyperathletic prowess to exquisitely poised lyrical refinement.  The recital opens with dazzlingly calibrated fireworks for Liszt's 15th Hungarian Rhapsody (\"after Vladimir Horowitz,\" with whom Volodos justifiably invites comparison--as he did on his spectaculardebut album--for his sinewy, larger-than-life negotiation of its thunderous octave runs and tangle of skittering flourishes). A far different world is brought to life in the enigmatic, compressed motivic echoes of the Scriabin pieces. The multiply trilled outbursts of ecstatic transport in his Sonata No.&nbsp;10  beckon and dissipate like voluptuous hallucinations. Volodos can master the kind of interior poetry--breathtaking in its simple eloquence--needed for the two Rachmaninoff &Eacute;tudes-tableaux.  So too the aching, barely achieved tranquillity Schumann calls for in the most introspective of the \"Bunte Bl&auml;tter.\" Indeed, the variety of tonal color, warm legato, playful animation, and fully voiced harmonies Volodos brings out suggests the \"varicolored leaves\" of the collection's title.  This is pianistic poetry that lingers long in the mind's ear, as it undoubtedly did for the lucky audience that night in Carnegie Hall.--Thomas May"}

WhereLive Alivecaptured Vaughan and his band Double Trouble in full arena roar andIn the Beginningrecorded a looser early club gig,Live at Carnegie Hallfinds the outfit broadening its range with guest shots from Dr. John and the Roomful of Blues horn section.

{"title": "Live at Carnegie Hall", "description": "This is a dazzling recital, taped live at Carnegie Hall in November 2003--complete with applause. Lang Lang's virtuosity is almost frightening: the Liszt \"Reminiscenses du Don Juan\" is a showpiece when played \"normally.\" Here, Lang plays it to its extremes, with soft passages amazingly soft and subtly delineated and the bigger moments heaven-thundering. And it is played so fast, and so accurately (a cascade of notes in mid-\"La ci darem la mano\" sounds like a waterfall), that it leaves the listener breathless--surely just what Liszt wanted. In a Haydn sonata, Lang's classical line is impeccable, but he's not afraid to shine through the music and embellish occasionally. The Schumann \"Traumerei\" is suitably dreamy and hushed; Schubert's \"Wanderer\" Fantasy, a real crowd-pleaser, is just that--beautifully played, familiar yet fresh sounding. And an encore, with Lang's father playing a two-string fiddle called the erhu, is a fascinating look into Eastern music. There's more (this is a 2-CD set), and it's stunning--and highly recommended for all admirers of great piano playing.--Robert Levine"}

He's also a solid, if admittedly idiosyncratic, vocalist who effectively personalizesStevie Wonder's \"Boogie on Reggae Woman\" with some swamp soul and totally reinvents theIsley Brothers' hit \"It's Your Thing.\" Eaglin delivers more traditional New Orleans fare, such asFats Domino's \"Josephine,\"Earl King's \"Soul Train,\" and his own classic party favorite \"I Went to the Mardi Gras,\" with equally satisfying results. The deep blues workout \"Black Night\" and a reprise of producer-songwriterDave Bartholomew's gem \"Yours Truly,\" Eaglin's first regional hit more than four decades ago, allow the boisterous blind virtuoso to exhibit still more of his expansive musical reach.--Michael Point", "title": "Live in Japan"}

The group had hit the top with exciting hits like \"Up The Ladder To The Roof,\" \"Stoned Love\" and \"Nathan Jones,\" maintaining their popularity after Diana Ross had departed the original Supremes lineup for a solo career in 1970. The group was promoting its latest album, The Supremes Produced And Arranged By Jimmy Webb, while \"Bad Weather,\" written and produced by Stevie Wonder, was their new single. A Japanese crew recorded the show on June 3, offering the fans a chance to hear the group tackle a variety of material, including live versions of the new Supremes' hits and Jean Terrell singing the sixties hits. However, along with subsequent live \"In Japan!\" albums by The Temptations and the Jackson 5, the Supremes live album was never issued in the U.S. (An edited version was issued in the U.K.) A few months after this recording, Jean and Lynda left the group, replaced by new lead singer Scherrie Payne and returning Supreme Cindy Birdsong, respectively. Now, for the first time on CD, and available in any format for the first time outside of Japan and England, is the classic Supremes' In Japan! album. The original artwork is faithfully reproduced, down to the accompanying Japanglish lyrics and liner notes, in which these new Supremes are introduced as, um, \"Mary Wilson, Linda Lorenz and Tina Duress.\" However they are called, Supremes fans take note: In Japan! is their only album featuring this lineup."}

In 1944, after both his parents had passed away, 12 year-old Chinmoy entered the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, a spiritual community near Pondicherry in South India. Here he spent the next 20 years in spiritual practice - including long hours of meditation, practising athletics, writing poetry, essays and spiritual songs.In his early teens, Chinmoy had many profound inner experiences, and in subsequent years achieved very advanced states of meditation. In 1964, he moved to New York City to share his inner wealth with sincere seekers in the West.Sri Chinmoy sees aspiration - the heart's ceaseless yearning for ever higher and deeper realities - as the spiritual force behind all great advances in religion, culture, sports and science. By living in the heart and aspiring for continual self-transcendence, men and women can bring forward the best in themselves and find their path to true satisfaction. In his words:\"Our goal is to go from bright to brighter to brightest, from high to higher to highest. And even in the highest, there is no end to our progress, for God Himself is inside each of us and God at every moment is transcending His own Reality.\"Sri Chinmoy serves as spiritual guide to students in some 60 countries around the world, encouraging a balanced lifestyle that incorporates the inner disciplines of prayer and meditation with the dynamism of contemporary life.Sri Chinmoy's life was an expression of boundless creativity. His vast output spans the domains of music, poetry, painting, literature and sports. His contributions in each of these fields have been striking and far-reaching.Sri Chinmoy frequently travelled throughout the world to offer free concerts, lectures and public meditations, to meet with his students, and to meet and discuss spirituality with world and community leaders. Sri Chinmoy did not charge a fee for his spiritual guidance, concerts, lectures and public meditations.Sri Chinmoy entered Mahasamadhi - the mystic process through which spiritual Masters leave the body, on the morning of 11 October 2007.", "title": "Love"}

{"title": "Love", "description": "The first page of Toni Morrison's novelLoveis a soft introduction to a narrator who pulls you in with her version of a tale of the ocean-side community of Up Beach, a once popular ocean resort. Morrison introduces an enclave of people who react to one man--Bill Cosey--and to each other as they tell of his affect on generations of characters living in the seaside community. One clear truth here, told time and again, is how folks love and hate each other and the myriad ways it's manifested; these versions of humanity are seen in almost every line. Monsters and ghosts creep into young girls' dreams and around corners and then return to staid ladies' lives as they age and remember friendships and cold battles. Men and women--Heed, Romen, Junior, Christine, Celestial, and the rest of Morrison's cast--cry and sing out their weaknesses and strengths in rotating perspectives. Sandler, a Cosey employee, is a brilliant agent of Morrison's descriptions of human behavior, \"Then, in a sudden shift of subject that children and heavy drinkers enjoy, 'My son, Billy was about your age. When he died, I mean.'\"  And Romen is allowed to play hero by saving a young girl from a brutal gang rape, while at the same time, he battles disgust like no superhuman would be caught dead feeling.Though slim in pages, Morrison constructsLovewith a precision and elegance that shows her characters' flaws and fears with brutal accuracy.Lovemay be less complex than others in the grand Morrison oeuvre, but not because Morrison performs literary hand-holding. Readers will experience in this smooth, sharp-eyed gem another instance of the Toni Morrison craftsmanship: she enters your mind, hangs a tale or two there, and leaves just as quietly as she came.--E.

His skill at infusing emotion into a lyric is supremely evident on tracks like his own  \"That's What My Heart Needs\" andSam Cooke's \"Nothing Can Change This Love.\" Redding turned his reading of the standard \"Try a Little Tenderness\" into a legitimate R&B; classic, and when it comes to pure and honest delivery, no one can match the much-missed pioneer on tunes like \"Just One More Day\" and \"I've Been Loving You Too Long.\" Tunes like \"Love Man\" alongside versions of \"A Lover's Question\" and \"Higher and Higher\" seem almost like filler compared to Redding's outstanding performances on \"Just One More Day\" and \"For Your Precious Love.\" All in all, this collection is a virtual textbook guide to true, to-the-bone soul singing.--David Nathan", "title": "Love Songs"}

Among the album's highlights is their original recording of \"(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away,\" a 1978 solo hit for Andy Gibb that the group recorded for a 1979 compilation and was covered in 2005 on the recent Barbra Streisand/Barry Gibb discGuilty Pleasures. The collection's sole solo outing is \"Juliet,\" from Robin Gibb's 1983 LPHow Old Are You?The first truly timeless love song from the Brothers Gibb--Maurice, Robin and Barry--appeared in 1967 with \"To Love Somebody.\" Both that song and the following year's \"Words\" were Top 20. \"First of May\" cracked the Top 40 to end the '60s. The Bee Gees then became the biggest pop group on the planet. 1971 brought \"Lonely Days,\" their first U.S. #1 and first U.S. gold record, as well as the gold #1 \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.\" The trio's contributions to 1977'sSaturday Night Feverhelped make history when that soundtrack became music's top-selling album (15 times platinum, certified Diamond, still the biggest selling soundtrack ever). Its gold #1 Grammy-winning \"How Deep Is Your Love\" ranked in the Top 10 for 17 straight weeks, setting a Billboard record. \"More Than a Woman\" was also heard on that landmark album. \"Emotion,\" a 1978 hit for Samantha Sang, was performed by the Bees Gees for 2001's retrospective-plusThe Recordbefore Destiny's Child took it Top 10. In 1979,Spirits Having Flownspun off the platinum #1 \"Too Much Heaven.\" \"Heartbreaker\" was first heard sung by Dionne Warwick in 1982 but was later recorded by the Bee Gees forThe Record, as was \"Islands in the Stream, which in 1983 went #1 Country/#1 pop for Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, and is included here as a live version. Culled from the Bee Gees' four final studio albums are \"Secret Love\" (1991'sHigh Civilization), the Adult Contemporary Top 40 hit \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1993'sSize Isn't Everything), \"Closer Than Close\" and \"I Could Not Love You More\" (both from 1997'sStill Waters), and \"Wedding Day\" (2001'sThis Is Where I Came In). The Bee Gees were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and have earned 16 Grammy nominations and won seven Grammy Awards, including the prestigious Grammy Legend Award in 2003.

While Dave Brubeck is an influential pianist and one of the leading lights of the dry, West Coast \"cool\" school of jazz, his poker-faced approach to tonal inflections and his emphasis on tricky, technical time signatures is not the sort of thing that makes people feel cuddly. The exception occurs on the lead track, a stirring rendition of Rodgers and Hart's \"My Romance\" that has Brubeck setting an intimate mood with a contemplative opening solo. After that, Desmond's lyrical &eacute;lan bears most of the romantic burden. He is generally up to the task, capturing just the right mix of whimsicality and wistfulness on \"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)\" and teaming with Brubeck for a wonderfully understated treatment ofWest Side Story's \"Somewhere.\" There are some misfires: the rhythmic backing on \"La Paloma Azul\" sounds hopelessly anachronistic beside today's Latin and Afro-Cuban offerings, and the record's lone previously unreleased song, \"You Go to My Head,\" lacks the cohesion customary of a Brubeck ensemble. But overall, this is a pleasant collection that offers a less cerebral side of Brubeck as he assays pieces from the Great American Songbook.--Britt Robson"}
{"title": "Love Songs", "description": "Whether he's collaborating with longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin or other songwriters (such as hisLion Kingpartner, Tim Rice) Elton John has written and performed some of the most cherished love songs in the pop-music canon. This career-spanning retrospective spotlights that particular aspect of his artistry, focusing on classics such as \"Your Song,\" \"Believe,\" \"The One,\" \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word,\" and \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.\" The album takes a rather expansive view of the concept--there are also tracks here such as \"Daniel,\" which is less a love song than a tribute to a wounded war veteran, and a live take of \"Candle in the Wind,\" which, kiddies, was once a song about Marilyn Monroe, not Princess Diana. John'sLion Kingtriumphs--\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" and \"Circle of Life\"--are included, as are a pair of new tracks, \"You Can Make History (Young Again\") and \"No Valentines.\" The album may stray from the topic a bit, but there's little doubt that these songs are among his most essential.--Daniel Durchholz"}

{"title": "Lucky", "description": "Grade 9 Up&ndash;This is de Oliveira's first novel, and he's a writer to watch. Sam Smith is a young, sexually confused teen living in Surrey, England. He enjoys hanging out with his friends, Brenda and Pod, and is passionate about playing on the local football team. Then he meets self-confident Toby, another gifted player, who happens to be gay. Toby introduces Sam to the contemporary gay scene in London, which includes Soho nightlife. Sam is intrigued and wonders if he might be gay, as well, especially after he notices mysterious and attractive \"Him,\" a young stranger who occasionally shows up at football games. Eventually Sam comes to the realization that \"These are the facts. I'm attracted to boys and girls.... I'm just Sam. I was born like this.\" De Oliveira has a mature, concise writing style and an excellent command of narrative pacing and dialogue. Sam and his friends are believable characters, flawed but likable, and the author's examination of contemporary British youth will probably intrigue American readers. Raw language and British slang (snogging, shagging, poof, cheeky git, etc.) are used liberally throughout, which requires some adjustment at first. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful novel that should appeal to relatively sophisticated young adult readers.&ndash;Robert Gray, East Central Regional Library, Cambridge, MNCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "Melissa Etheridge's considerable talents as writer/singer/performer have often seemed confounded by expectations--the artist having burdened herself with more than a few of them. Etheridge spent the '90s alternately proving her mettle as one of the era's most successful female rock artists (peaking with the multi-platinumYes I Am), trying to recapture those glories, then plumbing the depths of an all-too-public romantic flame-out on '01's confessionalSkin.  But here, the singer seems content to engage in a little musical soul-baring of a wholly different stripe, showcasing her bluesy, ever expressive chops on a record that refuses to apologize for its contemporary production slickness and unashamed positive vibes. The ghosts of recent personal troubles get swept away by the breezy of \"When You Find the One\" and the romantic anthem \"This Moment\" and the wistful \"Will You Still Love Me.\" \"Mercy\" engages her in a compelling, reflective duet with vocalist Bernie Barlow while the spare, bittersweet \"Tuesday Morning\" pays tribute to the heroes of 9/11. There's a confidence born of maturity and hard-won wisdom throughout--and the courage to simply play it straight down the middle of the road.--Jerry McCulley", "title": "Lucky"}

{"description": "This collection of short stories lacks some of the artistic sophistication of most books from art comics publisher Drawn &amp; Quarterly&mdash;the drawings are, in fact, about as bare bones as it gets&mdash;but it still manages to be completely engrossing. Paradoxically, the stories are interesting&mdash;even addictive&mdash;because Bell has such a flair for communicating a specific brand of postcollegiate ennui. Her day-to-day existence is a litany of dilapidated rental apartments, low-paying jobs, yoga classes and artistic frustration, but Bell's straightforward storytelling reveals a true poignancy amid the tedium. Far from being depressing, these snippets of daily life in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, N.Y., are comforting in their frankness and familiarity; by settling into the rhythm of the artist's daily life, the reader experiences the heft of small victories and simple pleasures. Never laugh-out-loud funny, brief tales of yoga roommate miscommunication, ignorant comics buyers, the anguish of nude modeling, and sex-obsessed, adolescent art students radiate good humor and are sure to resonate with a certain stripe of well-educated, underemployed 20-something comic reader.Luckyis yet another sophisticated, nuanced pleasure.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "When Sebold, the author of the current bestseller The Lovely Bones, was a college freshman at Syracuse University, she was attacked and raped on the last night of school, forced onto the ground in a tunnel \"among the dead leaves and broken beer bottles.\" In a ham-handed attempt to mollify her, a policeman later told her that a young woman had been murdered there and, by comparison, Sebold should consider herself lucky. That dubious \"luck\" is the focus of this fiercely observed memoir about how an incident of such profound violence can change the course of one's life. Sebold launches her memoir headlong into the rape itself, laying out its visceral physical as well as mental violence, and from there spins a narrative of her life before and after the incident, weaving memories of parental alcoholism together with her post-rape addiction to heroin. In the midst of each wrenching episode, from the initial attack to the ensuing courtroom drama, Sebold's wit is as powerful as her searing candor, as she describes her emotional denial, her addiction and even the rape (her first \"real\" sexual experience). She skillfully captures evocative moments, such as, during her girlhood, luring one of her family's basset hounds onto a blue silk sofa (strictly off-limits to both kids and pets) to nettle her father. Addressing rape as a larger social issue, Sebold's account reveals that there are clear emotional boundaries between those who have been victims of violence and those who have not, though the author attempts to blur these lines as much as possible to show that violence touches many more lives than solely the victim's.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Lucky"}

Brad Smith was a small town boy who caught the same fever that was gripping his entire generation: the burning desire to be a rock and roll musician.  He would eventually hitch his wagon to a shooting star that burned too brightly for this world, and would watch his dreams come to fruition and then slip away.   Smith had his modest beginnings in 1968 in the small, rural Mississippi town of West Point.  During his childhood he split his time between his mother&#x92;s house, his grandmother&#x92;s (known as &#x93;Big Mama&#x94; from the song Instead) and yes, he also spent some quality time with his father in the trailer park made infamous by the song Speed Bumps.  His memories from this time are mostly fond, learning life lessons and the value of hard work from his family.   He was soon introduced to the classic rock of the seventies by his mother and uncle, and forsook his private-school status as &#x93;Mr. Oak Hill Academy&#x94; for the trappings of a rock and roll life.  He and his childhood friend Rogers Stevens began cobbling together a garage band as they dreamed of making it on the world stage.  After a year of college, Smith and Stevens decided to pack up their belongings and head for the promised land of stardom that was Los Angeles, California.   Upon arriving, the brothers-in-arms set about working in construction and trying to keep their heads above water.  They quickly learned the rules of the mean streets, a saga chronicled in the song Slow Down Good Times.  They soon hooked up with a talented guitarist named Christopher Thorn and their old friend drummer Glen Graham, and began making music.  Their fate was later sealed as they were joined by a vocalist named Shannon Hoon and formed the band Blind Melon. The story of Blind Melon is by now well documented.  Their first album was carried to quadruple-platinum status on the strength of a simple song called No Rain and its quirky video starring the charming, dancing bee girl.  World tours soon followed along with monetary success and fame.   The pressures of that life took their toll on Hoon, however, and on October 21, 1995, just after their second album Soup was released, Shannon Hoon was found dead of a drug overdose in New Orleans.  The band&#x92;s tour came to a grinding halt, and there were very few pieces left to pick up.  The remaining band members eventually put together an album of previously unreleased songs entitled Nico, the name of Hoon&#x92;s surviving daughter, and dedicated the proceeds to her.  The death of Shannon Hoon had a profound effect on the life of Brad Smith.   &#x93;I was so used to touring and making music with my friends, and then it was just over with,&#x94; Smith says.  His life &#x93;stood still for six months&#x94; after the tragedy, even though his perspective remained pragmatic.  When asked, he ultimately places responsibility for Shannon&#x92;s death on Hoon&#x92;s own shoulders. &#x93;I was right there on that same tour bus with everybody else, and I made better decisions than he did,&#x94; he says about the friend he &#x93;sorely&#x94; misses.    Devastated, drained, and grieving for his lost band mate, Smith retreated to his Seattle home and his in-house recording studio, Stank Face Laboratories.  He spent several years working on the songs that would become the Mercy solo album, and found that writing and composing provided him with much-needed therapy after such an emotional upheaval. When the album was ready to record he called in Christopher Thorn to produce.  Smith took turns playing most of the instruments, and invited a few friends in to play some other tracks, including On the Blink and Stompin the Fuse, on which he reunites with his former Blind Melon members.  Once finished, he dubbed his solo project with the name Abandon Jalopy. Some of the songs on Mercy directly examine his feelings towards Hoon&#x92;s death.  Stompin the Fu"}

{"title": "Mercy", "description": "Heron, a nurse and author of the nonfiction bestseller Intensive Care , cobbles together a lumpy, unevenly written novel from disparate elements of New Age mysticism, creepy thrillers and standard romantic yarns. Red-haired heroine Cat Richardson is a deliberately daffy, self-confessed \"Sister of Masochism\"--a nurse, that is--at San Francisco's Mercy Hospital, where she gives her superiors plenty of grief and her patients enormous support. Entrusted to her care are Corky, a suicidal adolescent, and Lucy Cross, a gifted artist viciously beaten by her boyfriend, a tormented male model. A blind newsseller named Gage who possesses \"the sight\" knows that Cat has power she isn't tapping. As her spiritual guide, Gage eggs her on toward danger and romance with the cop investigating the Cross case. (\"You wear the haunted look of someone who has stared the beast in the face and survived,\" that swain observes.) There's a creative, rough-edged charm to the cheerfully obscene repartee between Cat and best friend Nora, but the heavy-handed psychological motives fueling the action owe a lot to bestsellers from the thriving recovery industry.

{"title": "Mercy", "description": "In her nonfiction books ( Letters from a War Zone ) and her first novel ( Ice and Fire ) Dworkin established a reputation as a provocative writer of feminist literature. She gives her own name to the protagonist/narrator of this powerful, almost frenzied, admittedly autobiographical novel that chronicles her life and sexual victimization. \"Andrea\" gets her first taste of sex at age nine when she is molested in a movie theater. A rebellious teenager, she hangs out in Greenwich Village, idolizes Allen Ginsberg and is swept up into the peace movement. Penniless, streetwise but not street-smart, Andrea is continually and brutally raped by lovers, acquaintances, strangers. The novel's unparagraphed prose--like Andrea, intense, jumpy, impassioned--brilliantly captures the narrator's mental and physical degradation. As her life disintegrates, she repeats three facts--her name, her place of birth and the poet Walt Whitman's address in Camden, N.J., on a street where she was born--as a mantra anchoring her to reality. The most sexually graphic and horrifying scenes involve her marriage to a European revolutionary who abuses and burns her as she desperately tries to be a good bourgeois housewife. It is no wonder that the novel's ending finds Andrea committed to the women's movement. While Andrea's high-pitched voice is at first hard to take, its vehemence and candor build to a convincing indictment of a society that tolerates violence against women. 25,000 first printing; author tour.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Mercy", "description": "Lindsey ( In the Lake of the Moon ) has constructed a lean, gripping, psychological thriller around a gruesome subject: a series of brutally sadistic murders among the lesbian demimonde of monied Houston. The victims are found nude, beaten, bitten, slashed--and perfumed and flawlessly made-up, but with their eyelids expertly sliced from their eyes. Lindsey's likable heroine, recently divorced detective Carmen Palma, frantically tries to discover the murderer before another strike, battling both male chauvinism within the department and a growing discomfort with her task: exposure to the brutalized corpses is destroying her peace of mind. Still, she's tough, her powers of deduction remarkable, and the investigation moves swiftly--though it's periodically upstaged by erotic descriptions of murder and incest as well as enlightening asides on the nature and psychology of lesbianism, serial murder, transvestism, fetishism, bisexuality and sadomasochism. In all, Lindsey seems to have achieved a paradoxical goal: to create a sexually charged thriller that entertains in a responsible manner. Written with masterly skill, his chilling, provocative story is propelled by sophisticated characterization, credible dialogue and accurately rendered details.

The author's prose is clear and crisp, with only a few lapses into Lovecraftian hyperbole: his description of the novel's almost mythical setting is rich and detailed without being overwritten and his characterization of the woman, Beck, and the very unusual creatures she encounters is compelling. Peretti successfully incorporates several contemporary detective drama/suspense thriller tropes; one of his main characters, for example, is a crime scene investigator, and welcome doses of forensic evidence and DNA analysis are thrown into the mix. But the novel suffers from too many supporting characters, and Peretti's failure to develop them greatly compromises the conclusion. More problematic, though, is the novel's agenda with regard to the theory of evolution. Not raised overtly until the middle of the book, Peretti's critique of certain aspects of Darwinism eclipses the story and leads it to an unsatisfying and somewhat confusing end. As in Peretti's previous novels, those who hold conservative views are portrayed as heroic and those who disagree as evil. The novel's devolution into this simplistic moralism, however, will not keep Peretti fans away, and its many merits may attract other readers as well.400,000 first printing.

{"description": "Martinez (Too Many Curses) pokes at big-picture questions, like the nature of the universe and the meaning of life, with abundant, zany humor in this charming tale. Monster, who works in cryptobiological containment, first encounters Judy when he rescues her from a yeti that's trashing the frozen foods aisle of the Food Plus Mart. They meet again when trolls infest her apartment. As an incognizant&mdash;someone whose mind can't acknowledge magic&mdash;Judy soon forgets the bizarre events, but Monster suspects she's somehow involved with the recent uptick in dangerous cryptobiological happenings. When Lotus, keeper of a stone mysteriously linked to Judy, spirits Judy away, Monster attempts to come to her rescue, only to discover that he's in way over his head. Scary monsters and hilarious scenarios embellish a convoluted plot that suggests even night-shift workers might have a destiny.(May)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Monster", "description": "MONSTER, a slick and streamlined new stage adaptation of the Frankenstein saga written by Neal Bell...is faithful to Shelley, if not in all the exhaustive details, then at least insofar as it seizes on its thematic highlights. Mr Bell's adaptation pucks the major events from the narrative, and his language treads a colorful path: a mixture of fanciful poetics, glib wisecrackery and an occasional Anglo-Saxon obscenity that lends a contemporary tint to things. --Bruce Weber, The New York Times...a lean literate version of Shelley's often much-embroidered classic. Exploring Shelley's psychosexual undertones, Bell's version is more creepy than shocking in effect. He also provides a viable new conclusion for the novel's open-ended narrative. --Michael Sommers, The Star-LedgerStarting from Shelley's original, but with a sharp eye for cogency and a sharp ear for the turn of a phrase, [Neal Bell] has managed to locate the philosophic germ inside each of the horror myth's iconic scenes.

{"title": "Monster", "description": "R.E.M. pushed the jangle out of the picture withMonster, replacing it with reverberating snaps, crackles, and pops. An album that wraps itself to '70s glam finery while reaching out to the flannel-clad post-Nirvanathrongs, it largely succeeds at demonstrating that these Georgians still know how to rock. The MTV fave \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" kicks things off on a high note as Peter Buck's distorted power chords set the tone for the 12-song set. \"Strange Currencies\" may be alarmingly reminiscent of theAutomatic for the Peoplehit \"Everybody Hurts,\" but it's actually the superior song. \"Let Me In\" is a heavily distorted nod to the fallen Kurt Cobain. WhileMonsteris far from R.E.M.'s most consistent effort, it stands as a ragged and risky respite from safe and sound alterna-rock.--Steven Stolder"}

{"description": "As if to remind us that radio pop isn't just for kids, Colleen \"Vitamin C\" Fitzpatrick turns up the grown-up sassiness on her second album. Its percolating opening cut, \"The Itch,\" celebrates not just carnal urges, but also the other pleasures of serial monogamy--such as moving on. Similarly, \"I Can't Say No\" and \"Dangerous Girl\" speak up for giving way to sensation. Well-made like itspredecessor,Moreshows Fitzpatrick moving closer to pop perfection without quite reaching it. (A cutesy cover of theWaitresses' postpunk classic \"I Know What Boys Like\" is the only full-fledged loser among these dozen cuts.)

Together, they chase the sun to the island of Ibiza where they develop even more interesting relationships with the island&#x92;s leading drug dealer and a girlfriend of Estelle&#x92;s. Made in the late sixties, Barbet Schroeder&#x92;s (Barfly) directorial debut is a treatment of pleasure, pain and tragedy that stands apart from numerous counterculture exploitation films. With Academy Award&#xAE; winning cinematographer Nestor Almendros (Days of Heaven), More never resorts to predictable LSD-induced stylistics, but rather atypically adopts a style of objectivity to illuminate the ideas and emotions that contribute to a lifestyle of destructive excess.

True,George Jonescould work wonders with \"The Night He Can't Remember,\" yet Adkins, a cowriter, more than does it justice. Not that he sidesteps sorrow. The bittersweet \"She's Still There\" and the painful \"Don't Lie\" face it head-on. \"Every Other Friday at Five\" takes an uplifting look at the responsible side of divorced fatherhood.

She's always felt an affinity with underground culture, but not until her soul-searching trip-hop breakthroughRay of Lighthad this love been the sole mainstay of her albums. OnMusic, she's inducted the cool funk of Parisian electro-pop as the latest addition to her musical court, abruptly closing the chapter of the movement's niche status.  Here, French DJMirwais Ahmadzaitakes on the majority of production credit, withLight'sWilliam Orbitbilled on two tracks; the result is a collection of songs that often links arm-in-arm with Franco-techno groups ranging fromDaft PunktoAir.Madonna relinquished unprecedented production control onRay of Light, which resulted in the best album of her career. OnMusic, she does the same, dividing the CD into three distinct voices. Orbit's train-track-clacking drum loops churning under citrusy trance (\"Runaway Lover\" and \"Amazing\") shimmer for the headphone set. When Ahmadzai diverts from his pure-play French-style club burners (\"Impressive Instant\" and the title track), he employs several temporarily fashionable gimmicks such as vocoder effects (\"Nobody's Perfect\") and spacious keyboard work combined with  acoustic guitar (\"I Deserve It\"). Lyrically, Madonna's introspection and love songs are some of her most intimate. Given the surrounding context of the album, \"I Deserve It\" is an outright folk song, and on \"Don't Tell Me,\" she forgoes precisely enunciated singing for the aching plead of an emotive R&B; crooner.  For a second time, instead of exploiting an of-the-moment subgenre, she immortalizes it. And in doing so, she simultaneously draws massive mainstream attention to a deserving class of dance music and raises the bar for Top 40 pop.--Beth Massa"}
{"title": "Music", "description": "Michael Ball, Britain's leading musical star and multi-platinum recording artist, releases his new twelve track album, which takes its title from John Miles' seminal mega hit of 1976. Features some of Michael's favorite pop songs from the last thirty years. David Bowie's `Life On Mars', for instance, is a key number in Michael's solo shows. `Fields Of Gold' is a double homage: in part to Sting, one of Michael's favorite artists and to Eva Cassidy whom Michael feels recorded the definitive version of this beautiful song.  Simon & Garfunkel are represented by the classic `Bridge Over Troubled Water' which benefits from a simple, contemporary arrangement and vocal treatment; and the powerhouse `The Show Must Go On', one of Michael's all-time favorite songs and a smash hit with his live concert audience is also a poignant nod to the memory of the great Freddie Mercury. Ever keen to expand his musical repertoire and to challenge his voice, Michael has diversified on this album with the bossa nova-tinged `And I Love You So' which features a stripped down arrangement and some cool piano.  Michael co-wrote a new song, `I Am Loved' which appears as the penultimate track on the album before he gives full rein to his superb voice on a magnificent rendering of the title track."}

While FBI Special Crimes Unit agent Nick Houston goes undercover to track down the drug dealers who killed his sister, ski-masked burglars break into the Alexandria, Va., townhouse shared by Katharine Lawrence, special assistant to the CIA deputy director of operations, and her boyfriend/boss Ed Barnes. The intruders kill Katharine's friend Lisa and almost kill Katharine, who cannot convince them she doesn't know the location of the safe they came to rob. Despite wounds and a concussion, Katharine flees into the arms of good-looking neighbor Dr. Dan Howard, who drives her to the hospital where she wakes up unsure of her memory or who she is. Not knowing which of her protectors she can trust, questioning clues that don't make sense, unfamiliar even with her own face and figure, Katharine has nothing to go on but her instinct, which tells her to run. Nick, meanwhile, reveals his true identity (to Katharine's surprise but not to readers') just in the nick of time. A page-turner that moves too fast to dot every plot-related i, Robards's 23rd novel again spins satisfaction out of appealing characters who fall in love and bad guys who get justice.(Apr.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "Though he had made comedies with Robert De Niro (Hi Mom,Greetings!), a horror movie (Sisters), and a rock musical (Phantom of the Paradise), it wasn't until this 1976 film that Brian De Palma truly announced himself as the heir to Alfred Hitchcock. Written by Paul Schrader, this film is an homage toVertigo, with its own stylish twists and turns. Cliff Robertson plays a businessman who, while traveling in Italy, meets a young woman (Genevieve Bujold) who is a dead ringer for his late wife, who had been killed in a kidnapping years earlier. As he woos and wins her, the vibes get creepier and creepier because, well, something's not right about this woman. Interestingly, this film came out the same year as De Palma'sCarrie, a much more successful movie at the box office. But it was this movie that, for all its flaws, proclaimed De Palma as a stylist with a sure-handed command of visual storytelling.--Marshall Fine", "title": "Obsession"}

Dmytryk's Obsession is based on Alec Coppel's suspense play A Man About a Dog. Ignoring such niceties as subtlety and restraint, Robert Newton stars as Dr. Clive Riordan, the insanely jealous husband of Storm Riordan (Sally Gray). Not content with merely murdering Storm's American lover Bill Kronin (Phil Brown), Riordan chains up the poor fellow in a deserted building. His reasoning: should the police accuse Riordan of Kronin's murder, the doctor can always produce the live victim, who is blindfolded and has no idea who his captor is. Once the investigation into the man's disappearance has subsided, Riordan intends to kill his victim and dispose of the body in an acid bath (something like this actually did take place in London in the postwar years).

But then One comes. It is funny and brave and confronts Red: \"If someone is mean and picks on me, I, for One, stand up and say, No.\" All the other colors follow One's lead and become numbers too.

The book is well designed with bright colored circles and numbers on stark white pages accompanied by black print. The text is very simple but meaningful, and the moral is subtly told.

There are certainly no major problems.\"\"The chapter problems are excellent and challenge students at many levels. Chapter summaries are well written. The 'Why This Chapter' lead-ins are superb.\"\"The author has always produced a well written book that is easy to read. That is a comment I have heard from both other colleagues and students alike. This has always been a general strength of the text. I was happy to see the inclusion of the 'Focus On' topics as supplements to the chapter's material to excite the students about other topics in organic chemistry related to the chapter material. I think these are quite informative for the students.\"\"We have been using McMurry's text for the past several years here at UA, and I am, therefore, quite familiar with it. The general strengths include the readability and a wealth of good problems.\""}

{"title": "Organic Chemistry", "description": "Q&amp;A with David Klein, author ofOrganic Chemistry 1EAuthor David KleinHow does your method of teaching Organic Chemistry differ from other approaches and other texts?Current organic chemistry textbooks provide students with extensive coverage of reactions and the principles that govern those reactions.  But it is often expected that students will independently develop the necessary skills for solving problems.  Organic chemistry is much like bicycle riding.  It requires constant practice of very specific skills.  In order to ace an organic chemistry exam, students must certainly understand the reactions and principles, but more importantly, students must learn to become proficient at approaching new situations methodically, based on a repertoire of skills.  To address this need, I have developed a textbook that utilizes a skills-based approach.  My textbook includes all concepts typically covered in an organic chemistry textbook, but special emphasis is placed on skills development to support those concepts.  This emphasis provides students with a greater opportunity to develop proficiency in the key skills necessary to succeed in organic chemistry.Your previous supplement titles (Organic Chemistry I&amp;II as a Second Language) have been well received. How does that make you feel and how did that inspire you to write your own Organic Chemistry textbook?When I wrote my first supplement,Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it would resonate in the market.  So you can imagine how excited I was from the wonderful student responses and the large adoption list.  I was so thrilled to read the great reviews posted by students on Amazon.com.  It really meant a lot to me that they took the time to write such wonderful comments.  It was also so gratifying to receive unsolicited emails from students and instructors across the country, expressing appreciation for my books.  It meant so much to me because I understand that people are busy and it means a lot that they invested the time to reach out to me.  It makes me feel GREAT to know that my approach has made such a positive impact.How did you become interested in Organic Chemistry?As an undergraduate student, I did not declare a major in my freshman year, but in my sophomore year, I had the fortune of taking an organic chemistry class from a truly gifted instructor, Professor Lawrence Principe.  He made organic chemistry fun and interesting for me, and he inspired me to follow in his footsteps and teach organic chemistry.  I believe that every corner of this universe is fascinating, if you have the right teacher who can show you how fascinating it is.  If you think about, you will probably find that the subjects that you enjoy are the subjects for which you had a good teacher.  And the subjects you dislike are the subjects for which you had a bad teacher.  In short, teachers have a profound impact on their students, and it has always been my goal to inspire my students the way my mentor inspired me.What do you see as the future of Organic Chemistry? Are there any exciting developments on the way?Organic chemistry occupies a central role in the world around us, as we are surrounded by organic compounds. The food that we eat and the clothes that we wear are comprised of organic compounds. Our ability to smell odors or see colors results from the behavior of organic compounds.  Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, paints, adhesives, and plastics are all made from organic compounds. In fact, our bodies are constructed mostly from organic compounds (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.) whose behavior and function are determined by the guiding principles of organic chemistry. The responses of our bodies to pharmaceuticals are the results of reactions guided by the principles of organic chemistry. A deep understanding of those principles enables the design of new drugs that fight disease and improve the overall quality of life and longevity.  As time marches forward, we can expect to see great developments and achievements in all of these exciting fields.How many boards have you broken at one time in your Tae Kwon Do classes?For my black belt test, I had to break three boards with my fist, three with a side kick, and three more with an elbow.  I was given a total of three seconds during which time I had to break all nine boards, and it was exhilarating!David Kleinis a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University where he teaches Organic and General Chemistry. He is a dynamic and creative teacher and uses analogy to help students grasp difficult topics. Klein&rsquo;s unique informal voice and manner of presentation help students truly master key topics in this course. He is also the author ofOrganic Chemistry as a Second LanguageandGeneral Chemistry as a Second Language, which have both been highly successful."}

I could go on, but it's beginning to sound like a paean of praise, so let me end by congratulating the authors and publishers in producing what I am sure will become the standard text in organic chemistry.  Perhaps I should just summarise how I felt about the book when I came to put it down: refreshing, exciting and motivational.\"      --Tony Barrett, Imperial College London.\"The authors should be congratulated for compiling a book that should prove very popular with our students...the text is very comprehensive and covers key areas in a very attractive and user friendly way.\"       --Dr Don Green, University of North London.\"The book is brilliant - we have been waiting for up to 25 years for a decent British text.\"       --John Mann, Professor of Biol.

{"title": "Organic Chemistry", "description": "\"The major strengths of the Brown book are the clarity of discussions and the overall organization and order in which topics are presented. Just reading through any chapter, discussions typically provide a very polished and direct explanation of the topic at hand. Moreover the organization of the text proceeds in a manner that builds nicely, for example the reactions of alkyl halides are directly preceded by reactions to generate them.\"-Zachary D. Aron, Indiana University\"The strengths of the Brown book are, a reasonable organization, a fairly good mechanistic approach to organic chemistry, the biological highlights are very strong, very good selection of problems in chapter and at the end, the reaction summary at end of chapter is very useful, and the mechanisms within colored areas in the text help them stand out.\"-Jean Chmielewski, Purdue University"}

{"description": "For hardworking buckaroo and ranch owner Wylie Galt Gustafson, paradise sounds like galloping fiddle-backed swing, loping barroom waltzes, yodels floating down the canyon, and pedal-steel guitars leaping and flickering like a campfire. With his plangent, magnetic voice, Gustafson pulls familiar Western themes of horses, blue skies, and the romantic cowboy life into a timeless country sound, as at home in the honky-tonk as it is on the range. Though they focus on finely shaped new originals, Gustafson and his band--anchored in his touring group of Ray Doyle, Dave Reynolds, and Duane Becker--let the austere prairie heart ofBob Dylan's \"Girl from the North Country\" speak with an eloquence and soul rarely heard.Paradiseis not only the best cowboy album of 2001; it's among the year's finest country efforts to boot.--Roy Kasten", "title": "Paradise"}
{"title": "Paradise", "description": "Gurnah's powerful, ironically titled story evokes the Edenic natural beauty of a continent on the verge of full-scale imperialist takeover by the European powers. Set in Colonial East Africa as English invaders drive natives off the land and Germans plan a railway across the continent, the novel focuses on Yusuf, a teenager sold by his father into indentured servitude at age 12 to pay off a debt. Working in the shop of his exploitive Uncle Aziz, then trekking with a trade caravan, callow Yusuf learns the ways of the world as he encounters an Africa rife with tribal warfare, superstition, disease and child slavery. He also falls hopelessly in love with Amina, the adoptive sister of a fellow indentured worker; she was married off, against her will, to the much older Aziz, who, we learn, may not be Yusuf's real uncle. Born in Zanzibar and currently a professor of literature in England, Gurnah ( Memory of Departure ) conjures a cauldron of animosities among African Muslims, Indian merchants, European farmers and native tribes in a vibrant coming-of-age story.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc."}
{"description": "In a genre where sticking to the middle of the road is generally rewarded with airplay, is it any wonder smooth-jazz artists often save their truest, most revealing expressions for the end of the disc (after the powers that be pick the radio cut)?Such is the case with guitarist Tim Bowman's Paradise. Bowman's song titles and liner notes reveal a devotion to and a passion for God, but he keeps things pleasantly funky until very late in the proceedings. And it's obvious that Bowman's heart is in tunes like \"Walk With Me\" and \"Lord Move the Mountain\" (tracks nine and 10). The latter features a choir led by Vickie Winans and sounds like an out-take from Kirk Whalum's Gospel According to Jazz - only with a crunchy, blues-flavored guitar solo rather than sax. Marcus Abernathy's simmering, often percussive organ work on these two tunes helps bring Bowman to church, where he seems able to improvise with far more abandon than on earlier, secular tracks.Dana Davis' organ is less pronounced on \"I'll Never Forget,\" but it spurs that same sort of adventure as Bowman modulates between crisp, high, electric tones and darker blue notes. Another bold (and retro) production touch is Mark Bouldes' distorted electric piano lines on \"Show Me the Way.\"While Bowman displays solid chops throughout, his reliance on electronic drums and percussion leads to a certain generic feel between the tunes. While smooth-jazz radio will no doubt latch on to this aspect of the album, Bowman would be better off getting a real drummer and sticking to the material that most obviously inspires him.--- Jonathan Widran, JAZZIZ MagazineCopyright &#169; 2000, Milor Entertainment, Inc.--From Jazziz", "title": "Paradise"}
{"title": "Paradise", "description": "In this less than stellar first novel from the author of Ring, a mystical red reindeer symbol loosely links three pairs of star-crossed lovers as the three-part story meanders across many centuries. The novel's first part, \"Legend,\" chronicles the fate of the lovely Fayau and her husband, Bogud, who's left bereft on the prehistoric Mongolian steppes when invaders kidnap his wife and child. In \"Paradise,\" set on a South Pacific island in the 18th century, the European sailor Jones falls for the sensuous native, Laia. \"Dessert\" leaps forward to 1990s New York City and the arid southwestern U.S., where the editor Flora Aideen follows the classical music composer Leslie Mardoff for a photo essay, and in hopes of helping him to create a masterpiece. Suzuki fans who have been waiting for this first English translation may be disappointed by its stilted language and contrived plot.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "\"I was so enthusiastic to read your book on Saturday, especially after personally meeting you, that on my first leg on my return flight to Hawaii I actually read your bookParadisefrom front to back! I must tell you that I really enjoyed readingParadise!I loved the 'easy reading' of this book. The way you capitalized 'He' and 'Him' throughout the book caught my attention. The mixing of the Hawaiian language also was genius! You kept my attention the whole time and left me wanting to read more! By the way, the decision I made a long time ago was to go to the real paradise!\"   &#x2014; Tom Mortenson\"I&#x2019;m totally surprised at all the apologetics packed into this book that&#x2019;s supposed to be a fictional novel!  The story was suspenseful and intriguing enough to compel me to keep reading to the end of every chapter.  I actually finished it in one night because, honestly, I couldn&#x2019;t put it down. I had to find out how it ended!  Throughout the book, there was so much evidence to back up relevant topics such as creation/evolution, Catholicism, the resurrection, fulfilled prophecies, etc., just to name a few.  It&#x2019;s an easy book to give away because it satisfies the need for drama with fiction readers, as well as the desire for &#x201C;meat&#x201D; for the intellectuals!  I love this book and look forward to the feedback from those I give it to!!!\"  &#x2014; L Goodall\"[Paradise]is a good book and actually helped clear up some questions I had in my own life about works vs. Jesus. You make really compelling arguments for creationism I think you&#x2019;re right. The world and universe could NOT have been made at random as evolution posits. In fact, that&#x2019;s almost insane. I can&#x2019;t believe now that my college major actually spent so much time on that!  I think science is really just a way for humans to decode what God created in a way that is understandable to us. I suddenly don&#x2019;t look at the sky, clouds, the environment, other humans or really anything in the same way as I did prior to reading your book.  I was walking home earlier and looking at the sky and thinking, 'Wow, a true artist had to have created all of this.'

{"title": "Paradise", "description": "Like the two albums (American AcousticandPastorale) that preceded it,Paradiseby Eric Tingstad and Nancy Rumbel offers listeners the audio equivalent of a comfortable sweater and a favorite pair of jeans. The two veteran musicians continue to blend folk's expressive spirit with the meticulous nature of chamber music in ways that yield serene, instantly appealing backdrops for reading, watching the sun rise, or warming a gathering of friends in front of a fireplace. Gone is the duo's midcareer experimentation with energized, ensemble-based settings; what remains is the pair's core sound--Tingstad's sonorous acoustic guitars gracefully intertwined with Rumbel's lyrical passages for oboe, English horn, and ocarinas, embellished here with light percussion. Gentle almost to a fault at times,Paradiseis nevertheless amply supplied with pleasant melodies: the sweet breezes flowing through \"Sailing,\" the Spanish-tinged romance of \"As You Wish,\" and pair of engaging pop-classical hybrids, \"The Lowcountry\" and \"Rokeby.\" Highlights: the inviting Middle Eastern flair that adorns a tribute toOfra Haza(\"Ofra\") and Tingstad's animated \"The Lawnmower Song.\"--Terry Wood"}
{"title": "Paradise", "description": "One of Tom Harrell's stated goals is \"to find beauty in music and life.\"  On this sumptuous, 71-minute disc, the trumpeter and flugelhornist, augmented by strings and surrounded by sympathetic bandmates, succeeds admirably. This is beautiful music, more suggestive of a chamber group than a jazz one per se, though Harrell's full-bodied tone and tenorJimmy Greene's attractive gruffness give the music heft and swing. The production throughout emphasizes a lush density over which Harrell builds lovely tone poems, each one distinctive, though the entire CD, beginning with \"Daybreak\" and ending with \"Sunrise,\" suggests a coherent vision of reflection and introspection. The mood is sustained in the lengthy \"Wind Chant\" and \"Morning Prayer, Parts One and Two,\" where Harrell's smooth, rich sound is given full flight. Reminiscent ofFreddie Hubbard's CTI recordings of the early 1970s, this music showcases the logic and beauty of matching strings with strong, melodic trumpet playing.--Wally Shoup"}

{"description": "Two strong-willed characters maintain 11 years of unwarranted hostility based on a series of misunderstandings in this engaging romance, McNaught's ( Almost Heaven ) hardcover debut. Teenage socialite heiress Meredith Bancroft has a quick and disastrous secret marriage to unsuitably penniless Matt Farrell. Her domineering father tells each of them a series of damaging lies and speedily arranges a divorce. A decade later, Meredith, now vice-president of a department-store chain and engaged to a prominent banker, meets Matt again. The highly successful CEO of his own conglomerate, Matt has a well-deserved reputation as a ruthless corporate raider, and when he hears of Meredith's aggressive plans for her chain's expansion the two clash explosively. To complicate matters, Meredith discovers that they have never been divorced. Although marred by a melodramatic and contrived terrorist subplot, the ending is never in doubt. But by portraying her protagonists with verve and good humor, and adroitly mixing corporate maneuvers and passionate encounters, McNaught has produced a captivating tale.

She defines passion as a benevolent energy that infuses life with meaning and magic; it's not just about sex and lust, although they do play a role. Peppered throughout with poetic aphorisms,Passionexplains how to cultivate passion in yourself, and subsequently at work and in relationships. De Angelis writes, &quot;It's your passion that, throughout your life, will be your saving grace, for it will keep you going after your dreams when everyone advises you to give up, keep you searching for the right partner even when you're afraid he or she isn't out there, keep you traveling on the path of self-discovery even when you aren't sure where the road is taking you.&quot; The road is ultimately one of soul renewal, she says. While she occasionally waxes so spiritual as to get a bit drippy, much of her advice here is right on target."}

What makesPassionso undeniably huge is, of course, its global reach but also its expert handling of what could've easily become polyglot babble. Vocalists Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Youssou N'Dour, and Baaba Mal bring strong Middle Eastern and African voicing to the project, and Balkan textures come via the ney flute and doudouk. But Gabriel is the glue, offering electronic ambient flows between the multiple streams. Gabriel also brings something even less tangible: an awesome visual imagination that takes often seamless sounds and makes them impress the listener with picturelike colors and phrasing. This is, however, far more than an ambient global mix. To be certain, the intertwined rhythms stand out but always do so both unto themselves and as brushstrokes on a larger canvas. Never mind thatPassionhelped launch North American careers for N'Dour and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, this is a stellar musical achievement by any standard.--Andrew Bartlett"}

This extensive two-CD collection includes all the band's essential work--from their early affection for 1960s girl groups (\"In the Flesh\"), and new wave pop-rock (\"Hanging on the Telephone\"), to the later turn to discofied rhythms (\"Heart of Glass,\" \"Call Me\"), reggae (\"The Tide is High\") and even rap music (\"Rapture\"). That Blondie could churn out incredibly catchy radio-ready hits that defined the late-70s and early 80s without sacrificing their artistic credibility is a true testament to their blazing talent. Their rhythm section is incredibly tight, their mix of keyboards and guitar is always just right. Several remixes and an unreleased cut are added as bonuses. But the real treat is just having all these great tracks backed up next to one another.--Rob O'Connor"}

All the same features you expect from Pro Ears passive hearing protection, but they provide a better fit for children and smaller adults-this means better hearing protection. Everyone&#x2019;s head and ear size is different. One size does not fit all and Pro Ears ReVO can make the difference for you!The ReVO Advantage is the great comfort and noise attenuation designed for a proper fit on youth and smaller adult heads.When total situational awareness is not required a great pair of passive ear muffs are the most effective means to protect your hearing. Ear plugs can be effective only if they are properly inserted in the ear. Very often, due to discomfort or improper training the ear plug does not provide the level of protection advertised. Many children find ear plugs uncomfortable. They may even be a swallowing hazard for very young children. A comfortable, well designed pair of ear muffs can protect your hearing for years. Proper fitting is essential to adequate protection. Most ear muffs are designed to fit the majority of the adult population. The size and shape of the headband and ear seals impact the fit &#x2013; if the headband is too big , the cups will not have the correct compression on the head and may hang too low. If the ear seals are too large, gaps will allow sound waves to reach the ear. If all the manufacturer does is shrink the size of the cup to fit a child&#x2019;s head, the noise attenuation will decrease. The ReVO is a revolutionary approach to solving these issues.", "title": "Pro Ears ReVO Passive Ear Muffs"}

{"description": "Black and white newborns and mothers are featured in full color in Australian photographer Geddes's latest postpartum spectacular. It has been more than five years since Down in the Garden, Geddes's bestselling set of stylized babies-as-flowers. These 123 new color and b&w; photographs offer a variety of mother-and-child poses and guises, many of which, through the ingenious use of body stockings and some careful camera work, simulate pregnancy: here are babies in fetal position on mother's stomach, held in place by flesh-like mesh; babies surrounded by strange, womb-simulating white fluff; babies projected into Mars-like pulsing red-yellow backdrops suggesting a living womb. The effect is unsettling, to say the least. There are also more conventional shots of newborns precariously balanced on women's backs or nestled at the breast, and simple, intense closeups of sleeping infants. Single words appear en face to the full-page photos: \"DELIGHTFUL,\" \"MIRACULOUS,\" \"DELICATE,\" \"CHERISHED.\" What aren't they doing? Screaming, eating, moving or looking expectantly at the viewer and demanding something they cannot yet verbalize.

{"title": "Pure", "description": "Grade 7&ndash;10&mdash;Tabitha, 15, and her four close friends wear purity rings symbolizing their commitment to abstinence before marriage. When Cara reveals she had sex with her serious boyfriend, Tabitha's best friend, Morgan, declares the breach of promise unforgivable and shuts Cara out, as does Cara's own best friend, Naeomi. Tabitha is caught in the middle, feeling empathy for Cara, yet still wanting to please Morgan, who reacts as if personally betrayed and chooses a new best friend. While sexual abstinence is one theme running throughPure(a book refreshingly free of sexual language, innuendo, or other titillation), the real themes here are the complexities of friendship and Tabitha's personal struggle to live out her Christian faith with integrity in her daily life. Her interactions with domineering Morgan are richly nuanced. The girls' religious beliefs and experiences are portrayed with respect and reflect authentic mid-teen maturity. While Tabitha extends forgiveness to Morgan, the ending is not pat or saccharine but shows personal growth. Tabitha's blooming romance with Jake and her positive relationship with her supportive, if somewhat quirky, parents add pleasant undercurrents to a book that girls of a spiritual bent will enjoy.&mdash;Joyce Adams Burner, National Archives at Kansas City, MOEND--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}

{"description": "\"I was about thirteen when I started letting the boys feel me up.\" Thus the reader is catapulted directly into the conflicted world of a smalltown English schoolgirl in 20-year-old Ray's relentlessly driven debut novel (she left school at 16 to write it). The narrator (whose name is never given) lives with her constantly bickering hippie vegetarian parents and her younger brother. Her self-pitying, feckless father obsesses over her homework, friends and clothes, and enlists her aid in belittling and disparaging her mother. When she reaches high school, the narrator desperately wants to join the in-crowd. She's in luck when she starts dating Robin, who is part of the popular group. Soon she abandons her former, less cool friends and spends lunch hours \"snogging\" with Robin. Strangely, Robin's touch does not appeal to the narrator until he hits her and she experiences her first sexual response. Robin loses his masochistic appeal when he says that he loves her, and the narrator moves on to Oliver, a 27-year-old consumer electronics salesman. Oliver's rough treatment proves orgasmic; his escalating violence releases her impulses toward self-mutilation. The narrator's befogged passivity (evidenced by her constant repetition of the phrase \"I wondered\") and her fascination with the sordidness of the physical side of life (a favorite word is \"disgusted\") make her mind a somewhat claustrophobic place to be, while her eventual insights into her family dysfunction will seem dated to those who grew up with Catcher in the Rye. However, the novel's structureAshort segments, no chapters and zingy clinchersAmoves this compelling story along swiftly to a surprising conclusion. The narration is leavened with touches of deadpan humor and spot-on observations that add credibility and demonstrate Ray's promise as a writer, despite some evidence of immaturity in her craft.

Even 2001&#x92;sThe Politics of Dancing, billed as the DJ&#x92;s first proper mix record, was given a dollop of post-production gloss. Too often, there&#x92;s a feeling something is missing, that blood and sweat has been replaced with something cold and muted. With a variety of guest vocalists on hand,Reflectionscomes close to a proper \"crossover\" record without taking the verse-chorus-verse plunge, and this actually gives it some heart. Jan Johnston&#x92;s cheerful mantra on \"Like a Friend,\" for instance, makes for a lovely bounce, like a lullaby with a beat. More often though, the ear drifts into a nostalgic desire for early mornings spent in dark clubs, listening to Van Dyk spin music with a little more meat on its bones. --Matthew Cooke", "title": "Reflections"}

He advanced rapidly, and soon moved on to study with harpist Edith Lundgren. By the time he was 16, he was performing professionally in fine hotels and restaurants in the Seattle area. After high school, Bronn was accepted to the School of Music at the University of Washington where he received instruction from Pamela Vokelek. He graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1985. Bronn&#x92;s musical accomplishments are known and appreciated throughout Washington State and the Northwest.

The former folk singer has honed her voice to a point where a few sustained notes can unearth a tune's emotional complexity--check the mixture of game whimsy and bittersweet regret she imparts on \"I'm Never Sure.\" As on her previous records, Shank delivers a unique twist on a contemporary pop song, turning theBeatles' \"Let It Be\" into a spiritual lifeboat, and she nods to one of her mentors with a heartfelt rendition ofAbbey Lincoln's \"Throw It Away,\" breaking into a rare, gentle scat over pizzicato strings. The backing trio (occasionally abetted by Shank on guitar) is accorded perhaps too much space, but singer and ensemble maximize every moment of \"A Timeless Place,\" an aching, sensuous, 10-minute tour de force that may well be Shank's finest recorded song thus far.--Britt Robson"}

{"title": "Remember Me", "description": "In a novel that's far subtler than run-of-the-mill Christian fiction, bestselling author Bedford (If I Had You) introduces us to Sam Tibbits, a beautifully drawn bachelor pastor who is sure to give Mitford's Father Tim a run for his money. As a boy in the late 1960s, Sam summered with his family at Piddock Beach in the Pacific Northwest. There, he became good friends&mdash;actually, more than friends&mdash;with a girl named Aubrey. They corresponded during the fall and winter and always looked forward to seeing each other again when summer rolled around. But during college, Sam arrived at Piddock Beach to find that Aubrey and her family had up and moved, leaving no forwarding address. The heartbroken Sam got on with his life, though he never married. As the novel opens, Sam is a minister who devotes himself wholly to his parish, and to his widowed sister and her son. He's a good pastor, but clearly on the road to burnout. To escape the pressures of his job, Sam returns to Piddock Beach and of course encounters Aubrey. On the surface, this novel explores the well-worn plot line of reconnecting with one's childhood sweetheart. But it's about many other things, too: Vietnam, vocation and the difference between dreams and reality. It's a multilayered, rewarding read.(Nov. 15)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}

{"description": "A couple of years after askingCan I Borrow a Dollar?and before he lost the \"sense\" in his moniker, the Chicago MC now known as Common dropped this impressive sophomore set, marking him as one of the most versatile MCs to emerge in the 1990s. Shirking the often derivative flows of his debut,Resurrectionfinds the Windy City rhymer ably assisted by the voluptuous jazzy excursions of producers No I.D. & Ynot. He revels in ear-tickling wordplay, slinging countless witty punchlines and similes on \"Orange Pineapple Juice\" and \"Communism\"--songs that require several listens to unravel. Far from relentless chest-thumping bravado, Common's lyrics have substance, exploring inner faults and fears on \"Book of Life\" and touching poignancy on his classic metaphorical ode to hip-hop culture, \"I Used to Love H.E.R.,\" a track that is perhaps more relevant today than when it was released. The beginnings of Common's ongoing struggle between his boyish effusiveness and moral responsibility, which figures greatly in his subsequent releases, is captured on this essential release.--Del F.

AfterFightandTwo, Halford's post-Priest \"experiments\" (read: attempts to expand his market base), failed to set the charts afire, it was the singer's career that seemed to need a little resurrection. Hence this (he claims) largely autobiographical, often strangely nostalgic trip down metal's memory lane. That Halford's black-leather sensibility extends beyond his couture is immediately apparent; the crunching, occasionally modern rhythms (Ray Chindeau on bass, Bobby Jarzombek on drums) and twin guitar assault (Patrick Lachman and Mike Chlasciak) offer a familiar metal landscape of thundering riffs and rapid-fire, diddly-squeak solos for Halford to unleash his ungodly howl upon, with the just the odd ballad (the touching \"Silent Screams\") to shift the mood from anxious/angry to melancholy/angry. Fellow fading metal merchantBruce Dickinsoneven drops by on \"The One You Love to Hate\" (self-esteem problems, fellas?) to swap some venom. Lest we forget that Halford was instrumental in inspiringThis Is Spinal Tap, there are lyrics here that thoroughly blur the line between the sublime and the ridiculous (\"Cyberworld\"'s dire warnings that the Internet is \"a Trojan Horse that eats your mind\") and mix metaphors (\"The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to be kicked\") with inspired abandon.

{"description": "Coleman Hawkins's 1939 recording of \"Body and Soul\" is one of the creative landmarks of jazz history, a brilliant exposition of the song's harmonic possibilities conducted with a stunning nobility. It makes a fine centerpiece for this two-CD compilation of jazz's first great tenor saxophonist. This set really is \"A Self Portrait of the Bean,\" as Ellington once entitled a composition. It ranges from Hawkins's dates as a sideman with such early groups as the Mound City Blues Blowers and McKinney's Cotton Pickers to encounters in the 1960s: with the vocal group Lambert, Hendricks and Bevan; singing \"Watermelon Man\"; and with Sonny Rollins. In between are masterful sessions with small groups and large that demonstrate Hawkins's ability to evolve as jazz did, without ever giving up his declamatory and highly personal style. His accomplices are a who's who of the best jazz musicians, including such prematurely departed legends as Charlie Christian, Fats Navarro, and the wonderful, if obscure, clarinetist Danny Polo. Highlights include several superb tributes to Paris, on two of which Hawkins single-handedly saves fine tunes from excessive arrangements, and two wonderful tracks from a 1957 Red Allen session on which Hawkins and the trumpeter match one another's exalted artistry.--Stuart Broomer", "title": "Retrospective"}
{"description": "In 1995, the label 4AD unceremoniously threw in the towel on Red House Painters and their tortured troubadour Mark Kozelek. As if to do penance for that move, they have blessed the devoted following of these brilliant mope rockers with this collection of hard-to-find and out-of-print tracks. The first disc of the set is a free-flowing montage of songs from the band's five 4AD releases that serves as an excellent greatest-hits collection, cataloging their slow-paced, shimmering guitar laments and exploring their heartbreakingly introspective style. With haunting reverb-laden atmospheres, epic song structures, and deeply personal lyrics, songs like \"Rollercoaster\" and \"Summer Dress\" alternately roar and recede as bewildered and lost protagonists wander through landscapes of evocative and sometimes nightmarish imagery. But alongside these dark ruminations are lighter moments, such as the sunny fade-out of \"San Geronimo\" and the tongue-in-cheekKisscover \"Shock Me,\" that betray the band's awareness of their own dour pretensions and ability to explore a full emotional palette. As good as the first disc is, the real fire lies on the second disc, especially for long-suffering fans of the band. Twelve outtakes and two never-before-released songs of harrowing vulnerability showcase Kozelek's thematic takes on confession and catharsis, twin motifs that have always defined his songwriting. Some are ambitious, like the early recording \"Roadkill,\" with its patient, complex song structure and long lyrical passages, while other songs are quiet wonders, like the acoustic renderings of \"Japanese to English\" and \"Mistress,\" both songs tracing a desperate search for lovers just out of reach. Taken together, the two CDs offer a captivating emotional experience, a chronicle of rarely explored, grandiose themes and a well-done summation of a tragically underappreciated band's catalog.--Matthew Cooke", "title": "Retrospective"}
{"description": "KRS-Oneis the most consistent rap artist (in terms of quality, not ideology) in the history of hip-hop--that's not debatable. What is debatable is why Jive Records would assemble a single-album retrospective for someone of this magnitude. A legendary rap career that spans over nine albums (to date) clearly deserves a box-set treatment. Sure, you do get a healthy sampling of his battle-rhyme headbangers from the beginning of rap's golden years in the late '80s (\"South Bronx,\" \"The Bridge Is Over,\" \"I'm Still #1\"). Likewise, the broad spectrum of politically conscious subject matter KRS-One masterfully waxes about is here: police brutality (\"Sound of da Police\"), antimaterialism (\"Love's Gonna Get'cha\"), safe sex (\"Jimmy\"). But for an MC whose material serves as a precursor to the profound protest rhymes of thedead prezorPoor Righteous Teachers, the glaring omission of any material from his majorly slept-onSex and ViolenceLP is bizarre. Also, the compilers could have easily bumped \"Step into a World (Rapture's Delight)\" or \"Jack of Spades\" and replaced them with rare 12 inches and B-sides such as \"Hip Hop vs. Rap\" or \"We in There.\" Thankfully, gems like \"My Philosophy\" and \"Essays on BDP-Ism\"--the lastBDPsong produced by DJ Scott LaRock--make this primer a great purchase.

{"title": "Retrospective", "description": "The 22 tracks onRetrospectivedeftly chronicle the best years of the Animals, who were far and away the grittiest band in the British Invasion of the mid-1960s. Eric Burdon's magnificently raw vocals and the stabbing chords of Alan Price's Vox Continental organ gave their covers of American blues and R&B; classic such as Sam Cooke's \"Bring it on Home\" and John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\" an authenticity that no other British groups could match. Their rough sound also gave songs like \"Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" and \"We've Got to Get of This Place\" a real sense of rage and menace. By 1967 Burdon was the only remaining original member and he formed a new band that eschewed the blues and R&B; of his early years in Newcastle in favor of a psychedelic, San Francisco-influenced sound. Songs like \"When I Was Young\" showed he had a real gift for the type of personal songwriting that was becoming popular in the late 1960s while the lyrically obscure \"San Franciscan Nights\" and \"Sky Pilot\" suggested he spent too much time hanging out with hippies. Even when they stumbled, the Animals were interesting, and when they hit the mark, they were as good as any band from the British Invasion.--Michael John Simmons"}
{"description": "The 26 tracks onRetrospectiveshow that it's not enough to just have hits, you have to have hits with the right songs. Herman's Hermits came to prominence during the early days of the British Invasion with a mix of odes to teenage love such as \"Can't You Hear My Heartbeat,\" \"Mrs. Brown, You've got a Lovely Daughter,\" and \"I'm Into Something Good\" and mildly rocked-up versions of ancient English music hall songs likeGeorge Formby's 1937 hit \"Leaning on a Lamp Post\" and the 1911 chart-topper \"I'm Henry the VIII, I Am.\" By 1966, two years after lead singer Peter Noone and his band mates scored their first hit, they were pigeonholed as a novelty act and their records stopped charting. Which is too bad because their later songs like \"No Milk Today,\" \"East West,\" and \"Don't Go Out Into the Rain\" are delightful dollops of late 1960s British pop. Many of these later songs featured string arrangements by John Paul Jones and guitar parts by Jimmy Page, who were both studio musicians before they formedLed Zeppelin. Herman's Hermits were not among the most important bands from the British Invasion, but their best songs perfectly captured the giddy spirit of the times and are certainly worth revisiting.--Michael John Simmons", "title": "Retrospective"}

{"title": "Revolution", "description": "A former White House economistpresidential assistant for policy developmentAnderson helped to develop supply-side theory or \"Reaganomics.\" Relating many behind-the-scenes anecdotes, his self-congratulatory, relentlessly upbeat reminiscence credits the Reagan administration with bringing about \"the greatest economic expansion in history\" and praises the President for ushering in \"the largest increases in social welfare spending in any country in history.\" Asserting that the likelihood of an accidental nuclear war escalates with each passing day, Anderson pursues the theory that a missile-defense system can prevent Armageddon. He interprets the Iran-contra affair as \"a clash of good ideas and bad ideas,\" with Reagan betrayed by his advisers. He exaggerates the extent to which China has adopted capitalistic measures.

{"description": "It's like the killer part of Dokken on a vegan protein diet...all the muscle without the cheese!Unlike nearly every other guitar hero from Lynch's era who have gone limp, become a parody of their former glory or simply vanished, Mr. Scary not only keeps his chops surgically sharp but has an uncanny knack for organically updating his sound & image without coming across as trying too hard.A lower, meaner, more focussed Lynch Mob...plays like the soundtrack to speeding down darkened highways.Full on international press & radio onslaught (in house & indies)Spring/Summer U.S. TourFrom the second the modernized &#34;Tooth And Nail&#34; comes blasting out of the speakers, all guns blazing, it is clear that REvolution had to happen. This choice collection of cuts is an impressive, unique retrospective of master Lynch's writing, shredding & retooling abilities, spanning back 2 decades! If you are one of the millions of Dokken or Lynch Mob fanatics out there who think you may have every one of these classic jams already in your collection, think again. George hand picked 13 of his favorite hits, dragged them deep into the bowels of Hollywood's world famous Henson Studios and with the aid of his fellow Mobsters disassembled each cut, trimming any undesirable '80s & early '90s fat to the bones. These master craftsmen then accomplished an amazing task, rebuilding those famous tunes, riff by churning riff, until each song absolutely sparkled with the metallic sheen of a rebuilt, finely tuned classic muscle car. Mr. Lynch has developed a discerning ear over the years. Lauded as a pioneer of the infamous Los Angeles Metal explosion of the early '80s with his groundbreaking axe work in Dokken, and taking said heroics up a few notches as the leader of the Lynch Mob not to mention his stunning solo projects, this is a man who not only dominates the art of guitar, but knows his way around a catchy hook, with multi platinum accolades to back it up. A living legend, Lynch continues to rEvolve convincingly, with power and grace. This record will not disappoint. --Cleopatra Records", "title": "Revolution"}

{"title": "Rise", "description": "\"Let's call this, the way a sound is born,\" suggests Jordan's speaker, with an acute desire to articulate beauty tempered by taut emotional restraint. Racial slurs, rage and fistfights receive a cold monotone; the voice softens slightly into empathy, melancholy and sometimes humor in response to music (Sidney Bechet, John Coltrane, Robert Johnson), the disenfranchised, \"[t]he philosopher, Richard Pryor\" or divine intervention: the radio played \"four Eddie Harris tunes in a row.\" In \"Beggar's Song,\" Jordan imagines the longings of a man afraid of love: \"If I could dream now,/ A dark woman would obsess/ Over my hands.\"Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc."}
{"title": "Rise", "description": "Louisiana bluesman Chris Thomas King's brilliant and beautifulRiseis an ode to New Orleans and its people after Katrina. These 11 songs ricochet between hope and tragedy, creating a emotionally complex cycle that's buoyed by his carefully considered performances--full of weeping electric guitar melodies and his gentlest, most soulful singing. The opening King-penned trilogy \"What Would Jesus Do?,\" \"Faith,\" and \"Baptized in Dirty Water\" essays the tests of strength and spirit that came with the floodwaters. King examines the nature of justice in these songs, raising questions about the federal government's blindness to the unfolding disaster and the moral compromises many needed to make to survive. He's also given some Crescent City classics new meaning. His take on the chestnut \"St. James Infirmary\" reflects on the musical history of New Orleans as well as the loss of life caused by the hurricane. And when Louis Armstrong's sweetly upbeat \"What a Wonderful World\" closes the album, its joyful lyrics provide an ironic counterpoint to the pain and suffering King chronicles as the rest ofRise's thoughtful songs unspool.--Ted Drozdowski"}
{"description": "Nashville's loss is Kim Richey's gain. Though she has written chart-topping hits forRadney FosterandTrisha Yearwoodand pursued a recording career on the fringes of the country mainstream, her fourth and best album sounds like a fresh start. It certainly doesn't sound like contemporary country, as the artist and producer Bill Bottrell (who helmed similarly creative breakthroughs bySheryl CrowandShelby Lynne) collaborate on a sensually bluesy song cycle that shows a determination to defy categorization, follow its own musical dictates, and find its own audience. The album-opening \"Girl in a Car\" sounds like it could have been a highlight forLucinda Williams, while the languid atmospherics of \"Fading,\" \"Without You,\" and \"Reel Me In\" have a seductive intimacy that is equal parts torch song and lullaby. From the Wurlitzer organ on \"The Circus Song\" to the bouzouki that lends an Eastern tinge to \"This Love\" and \"Electric Green\" (the latter written and sung withPete Droge), the stripped-down arrangements accent the freshness of the material.--Don McLeese", "title": "Rise"}

{"description": "Someone once said recording artists have their whole lives to write a first album and a year to write the second. As evidenced by the famous \"sophomore slump,\" too many bands know this all too well. Building 429 not only had this to deal with in contemplating a second release but were also coming off a New Artist of the Year Dove Award. Could expectations be any higher for Rise? Does it make the grade? Well, yes and no. The foursome still serves up plenty of power chord-charged rock that they so well introduced onSpace In Between Uswith \"Searching For A Savior,\" \"Fearless,\" and \"Fighting To Survive.\" Unfortunately much of it is similar in style to what Christian Music Row is churning out these days. But pay attention to the release's latter tracks which may make you wonder just what this band is capable of doing in the future. Those points of light include lead man Jason Roy never sounding so good as on the melodic \"Rise\"; Roy and guitarist Jesse Garcia whipping up a distinctive guitar hurricane on \"Now That It's Over\" and \"Alive\"; and, rhythm section Michael Anderson (drums) and Scotty Beshears (bass) throwing down an awesome groove for guest star Michael Tait (DC Talk) on the gritty \"Empty.\" Pardon the puns, but while this one may not be the proverbialRiseto the top, it is a leap worthy of your faith.--Michael Lyttle", "title": "Rise"}
{"description": "There are prodigies and there is progeny. Anoushka Shankar is both. As the daughter of sitar legend Ravi Shankar, she's got bloodlines and a teacher who is one of the greatest to ever play sitar. While Anoushka has pretty good classical chops (not the best, but pretty good),Riseshows her versatility and growth as a composer, arranger, and producer. The nine-song album features her sitar along with a variety of traditional Indian and modern Western instruments. She orders the ragas logically, starting with morning and working toward the final one at the end of the night, each one capturing the mood of its particular time of day. For example, mellow opener \"Prayer in Passing\" would be the initial waking moments, while the mood soon gets more upbeat on \"Red Sun\" before the midday heat sets in for the middle tracks and brings down the tempo. Traditionalists will call it pop, but there is nothing light or disposable aboutRise.--Tad Hendrickson", "title": "Rise"}
{"description": "There has always been a disconnection between the musical tastes of the U.S. and the U.K. A case in point is the career of R&B;/pop singer Gabrielle, whose third CD,Rise, came out in the fall of 1999 in her native England and is finally available stateside. Cognoscenti of the U.K. brand of R&B; (which on the whole tends to be less formulaic than its American counterpart) might remember that Gabrielle scored in the mid-'90s with the infectious club track \"Dreams.\"  Yet, despite that international chart topper and her smoky voice, her lovely 1996self-titled albumfailed to make any noise in the U.S. Although it's not as satisfying asGabrielle,Riseis a solid soulful effort. Once again, Gabrielle's semi-self help lyrics are married to state-of-the-art (but not obvious) beats: the title track uses the melody line fromDylan's \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" while the pulsating \"5 O'clock\" employs a bouncy Latin-tinged rhythm that conjures upBig Pun's \"Still Not A Player.\"  There's an airy, buoyant quality to the tracks and an almost wistful vibe that's totally modern yet has a strong loyalty to the legacy of soul when songs and singers mattered. Groundbreaking? Certainly not, butRiseis a refreshing antidote to R&B; by the  numbers--and proof that America doesn't have the patent on soul.--Amy Linden", "title": "Rise"}

{"title": "Sanctuary", "description": "As peaceful and enchanting as a sunset's afterglow on a cloudless summer evening, the gentle music of Riley Lee (playing shakuhachi flute, an instrument traditionally used by Japanese monks) and Bert Moon (on koto, a 13-string zither) stirs a warm, caressing breeze that calms the spirit and stills the mind. Lee, an Australian, is one of the few non-Japanese musicians to be acknowledged as adai shihan(grand master) of the shakuhachi, a fairly primitive flute made from a bamboo root. His talents are artfully displayed on this tranquil assortment of improvisational duets with Moon, recorded in 1984 and first released in 1991 as a meditative cassette titledEvening Mist. Lee's elegant, prolonged tones are gentle to the point of weightlessness, residing in comfortable low and middle ranges without sounding a shrill note. Moon, though not credited on the recording's front cover, admirably handles an egalitarian role throughout the disc's 61&nbsp;minutes, handsomely complementing Lee's cerebral textures with dignified, unobtrusive accents. Listeners raised on Occidental music will find little alien about Lee and Moon's graceful, unhurried duets, ideal for periods of restfulness or contemplation.--Terry Wood"}

Now, with the help ofBlind Boys of Alabamaproducer John Chelew, the 60-year-old has made a masterpiece that balances his music's Delta soul with sonic innovation.

{"description": "Popular Christian author Lewis and her husband collaborate here for the first time, refreshing Lewis's trademark style with a welcome edge of suspense. Protagonist Melissa James has a secret that has become the underlying dread that defines her life. An unexpected glimpse into her past causes her to flee her expensive home and pen a farewell note to her husband, Ryan: \"Please trust me... don't look for me.... \" What Melissa doesn't know is that Ryan, an investment manager, has made disastrous choices that could cost them their marriage. One of the keys to unlocking their elaborate facades lies in Melissa remembering the \"language\" of flowers she learned from her father. Although the Lewises craft some beautiful settings and show more restraint in the use of dialect here than in former titles, the pace is often slowed by overly descriptive passages and italicized text (a single page has 22 italicized words). Some scenes don't ring true, including one of spiritual warfare and another of a high school romance turned sour. It is also contrived that Lela, a Pennsylvania Dutch \"Plain\" woman, feels led to pray about opening her home to someone in need just as Melissa stumbles down a Lancaster road looking for a place to stay. However, the Lewises throw in some artful plot twists and adeptly avoid the trap of a fairy tale ending. The final choices made by Ryan and Melissa will satisfy Beverly Lewis's devoted readership, as will the salvation message that holds the story together. (June)Forecast: Lewis's novels have sold more than 1.5 million copies combined, and her faithful readers will be more than content with this latest offering.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.", "title": "Sanctuary"}
{"title": "Sanctuary", "description": "Starred Review. In these 40 black-and-white photographs, Crewdson (Beneath the Roses) travels to Rome's Cinecitt&agrave; studio, home to some of the most famous works of Italian cinema. While Crewdson emphasizes the artificiality of a film set (and the photographic medium itself) by portraying the Cinecitt&agrave; as a composition of gray tonalities, he also suggests the possibility of movement and life, and teases us with nonsensical elements that prevent the sequence from forming a coherent narrative: a small set of stairs leads to nowhere, dull light casts shadows through a distant doorway, and Roman architecture stands next to modern scaffolding. As film critic A.O. Scott notes in his lyrical preface, Crewdson--like the discontinuous world of the unconscious--gives us \"the sense that what we are looking at is both actual and illusory.\" Unlike Crewdson's previous work, those color-saturated shots like film stills, this collection addresses the dream world of film in a historically significant setting, but the relationship with the viewer remains intimate, as he or she becomes \"the solitary walker tiptoeing through secret places and dreaming fragmentary epics.\"Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "Su's debut gained her attention as a poet of Chinese-American identity; keeping one eye on her heritage, this clear, even conversational sophomore effort has an altogether wider scope. The strongest poems consider her recent pregnancy and motherhood. \"In the Maternity Shop\" complains that such stores infantilize their customers: \"Just when we feel least like ourselves,/ our selves are remade in the image/ of fourth graders, as if what we did to get here/ took place in immaculate ignorance.\" Poems about domestic troubles place Su in a line of frustrated, and yet loving, parents: \"Everyone's mother could have been someone.\" Other poems deal with broad themes, such as the problems a contemporary woman might incur searching the English literary canon for useful wisdom: \"it's not,\" she says, \"that it gives no instructions for shopping or cooking.\" Su (Middle Kingdom, 1997) rhymes with ease, never detracting from the accessibility she seeks. \"Subway riders\" rhymes with \"Ann Landers,\" \"Evian\" with \"Puritan\"; even Su's sestina sounds gentle and rueful (not virtuosic or forced). New moms in their twenties and thirties, along with fans of accessible poets like Jane Shore or Billy Collins, seeking poems for and about their own lives are likely to find them here.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Sanctuary", "description": "The Native American flute is not inherently versatile and R. Carlos Nakai, theYo-Yo Maof this instrument, knows it. That's why he's always looking for novel settings that range from Japanese ensembles to acoustic piano to global music groups. So to stand there naked with an instrument that has a one octave range takes a depth of resources that are both technical and spiritual. Nakai has both and he deploys them across this gently searing album of solo native flute works. Engineer Jack Miller gives Nakai just the right amount of reverb and delay to sheath his flute in an echoing glow without burying it in gimmick. It's like you would imagine a flute melody cast into a canyon to sound, only better. Serene, meditative, soothing; these are all easy adjectives for a CD that will become a staple of shiatsu massage parlors and yoga studios. But Nakai goes deeper than that, calling up the spirit of the desert southwest with every breath he exhales into his vibrato-tinged melodies. --John Diliberto"}

Words and phrases loosely associated with the seasons appear in a blocky pink font on each page of this contemplative book, above grainy prints with a decidedly retro flavor. The pages often play off one another, creating a succession of evocative observations. Debris litters a shady grove, but yields discovery for a black bird, opposite, tugging on discarded string. A gleaming plum, seen early, later becomes a prune. Figures engage in many recognizable activities, and a subtle sense of humor can be seen at work (a traffic jam mirrors a caterpillar crawl).

Haydn's version is an oratorio--essentially an opera without staging--in which three archetypal peasants sing of the joys and travails of country life throughout the year.  Coming after the sublime subject ofThe Creation, Haydn had qualms about the text, which he called &quot;Frenchified trash&quot; on more than one occasion. As if to compensate, the music he created was more colorful and vivacious than ever.The Seasonsis, in fact, the largest single vocal and orchestral work before Berlioz--larger even than Beethoven's Ninth. It firmly establishes Haydn as not only the first classical master, but a firm precursor of romanticism. And &quot;Romantic&quot; is exactly the word which describes the grand, exuberant performance--the best available.--David Hurwitz"}

{"description": "&#8220;Simply said, Robert Pinsky is one of the few literary artists working in our language whose work is unquestionably major work.&#8221; &#8212;Louise Gl&#252;ck&#8220;[Pinksy&#8217;s] poems are striking in their desire to open wide ... and contain everything, to refuse absolutely to reject anything ... Pinsky&#8217;s poems rarely lend themselves to easy and decisive interpretation. (For this reason they tend to grow rather than wither with rereading.) One might say of his work, as one would say of jazz, that the point is less to interpret or understand it than to enjoy the sound and energy and mad improvisation ... Sadness and happiness, beauty and ugliness, peace and violence&#8212;each has its place in Pinsky&#8217;s capacious poetry, for its universe is the one in which we all live.&#8221; &#8212;Troy Jollimore,The Washington Post&#8220;One might say that Pinsky has attended well Hamlet&#8217;s advice to the players, and, in the very tempest of his passion and inspiration, acquires and begets a temperance to give all smoothness. The pleasures of Pinsky&#8217;s poems are found in their capable smoothness, their balance, and, here and there, little fillips that smack the ear and jar the mind.&#8221; &#8212;Donald Brown,The Quarterly Conversation&#8220;Pinsky is an important figure. He is also, as Tony Hoagland has rightly observed, &#8216;a much stranger poet than is generally acknowledged.&#8217; This abiding strangeness, this ability to perpetually surprise us with his jittery music, oddball catalogues, and outright collage-making&#8212;gestures that at the same time are impeccably crafted and as often-as-not shaped into stately couplets and tercets&#8212;are one source of Pinsky&#8217;s significance. He has also, as the new volume eloquently attests, remade himself several times as a poet, and with each change moved closer to a goal of being at once wholly idiosyncratic and highly accessible. He is an exceedingly personal writer&#8212;this trait especially manifests itself in his capacities as an elegist&#8212;while at the same time very concerned with public subjects that too many of his generational peers have chosen to neglect . . . he temples of the ancient Sumerians employed various priests and functionaries, but one of the most important occupations was that of &#8216;chief lamenter,&#8217; the reciter and singer of hymns. The chief lamenters&#8217; function and artistry were civic, but the best of them must have had voices and individual styles comparable to the idiosyncratic majesty of Robert Pinsky. The past, he tells us in one poem, is a &#8216;haunted ruin,&#8217; like the &#8216;billion corridors / of the semi-conductor.&#8217; And that is Pinsky: he stands with sandaled feet on the ziggurat steps, while under his arm he carries an iPad. And . . . this lamenter-in-chief knows that his story must also be our own.&#8221; &#8212;David Wojahn,Tikkun&#8220;[A] sense of an American gathering extends throughout the volume, into the angry political poems ofGulf Music(2007), a reference to Hurricane Katrina, through the prose blocks of &#8216;An Alphabet of My Dead,&#8217; and back to what may still be Pinsky's most famous poem, the book-lengthAn Explanation of America(1979), excerpted here, whose clearly argued triads of blank verse compared the United States after Vietnam to the republic in earlier days&#8212;and to imperial Rome. However well Pinsky fits a wide modern audience, he is also someone whose poems should last.&#8221; &#8212;Publisher&#8217;s Weekly&#160;&#8220;For 36 years, Robert Pinsky has been writing his exciting, musical poetry . . . his poems bubble up and dissolve like fireworks, like something written across a stretch of blue sky, seen from the warm sand. &#8216;What is Imagination,&#8217; he asks in &#8216;Ode to Meaning,&#8217; &#8216;But your lost child born to give birth to you?&#8217; This is one exuberant collection. Baseball, desire, jazz&#8212;only poetry could hold them all.&#8221; &#8212;Susan Salter Reynolds,Los Angeles Times&#160;&#8220;This edition of Pinsky&#8217;s poems is as satisfying as a cross-section of his remarkable 35-year career could be. Its inverted chronological order allows one to trace the emergence of a public, civic-minded poet to his early concerns about the human mind and heart, &#8216;the legendary muscle that wants and grieves.&#8217; The poems in this book long ago established Pinsky as an ambassador for poetry, but this book reminds us that his poems still deserve the most attention of all.&#8221; &#8212;Dave Lucas,Plain Dealer(Cleveland)&#160;&#8216;Robert Pinsky&#8217;sSelected Poemsinvites us to read his career in reverse, to start with his most recent books and move back through the decades to his first . . . The book is therefore shaped more like a detective story than a traditional chronological narrative. The question is not where is the young poet is going, but rather, how did the older poet get to where he is. As Pinsky is one of the best American poets around, it is a question worth asking . . . Pinsky has gotten fiercer as he has gotten older, and the later poems suggest ways to read or reread the earlier ones. Pinsky has become something of a public figure . . . who has not sacrificed the complexities of poetic construction for a false, aw-shucks simplicity. HisSelected Poemsshows how this was always where he wanted to be. It is a generous selection in all senses of that word. It is a tribute to its quality that it is, at 200 pages, still too short.&#8221; &#8212;David Kaufman,Tablet", "title": "Selected Poems"}

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "His Selected Poems sets the violent brooding of Williams's (A Dream of Mind) early writing against the lucid equanimity of his more mature work. The poetry spans three decades and offers an outline of his development. We get only occasional glimpses of the crude brutality that characterizes the poems from Lies (1969) and I am the Bitter Name (1972) in the mostly affirmative selections from Tar (1983), Flesh and Blood (1987) and his other recent books. Early, physically explicit and jarring poems like \"Saint Sex\" lead to the more cerebral work that has come to represent his style. The poems excerpted from The Lark. The Thrush. The Starling. (1983) reinforce a reader's impression of Williams's versatility while offering a formal alternative to the lengthy, Whitmanesque lines that he appears to prefer. And, though not ground-breaking, the dozen new poems here offer a closing, microcosmic view of his career with topically and stylistically familiar work.

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "In 'Gloss / Cl&#xF3;s / Glas,' a poem originally published in The Girl who Married the Reindeer, and placed at the close of the new Selected Poems, the mystic material grows out of a traditional portrait. The poem portrays a scholar who, as he works in his study researching etymologies, experiences a kind of transformation. Here are the last ten lines:The rags of language are streaming like weathervanes,Like weeds in water they turn with the tide, as he turnsBack and forth the looking-glass pages, the wordsPouring and slippery like the silk thighs of the tomcatPouring through the slit in the fence, lightly,Until he reaches the language that has no word for his,No word for hers, and is brought up suddenLike a boy in a story faced with a small locked door.Who is that he can hear panting on the other side?The steam of her breath is turning the locked lock green.I love how effortlessly N&#xED; Chuillean&#xE1;in collapses the usual divisions between intellect and imagination: she has the books turn animal, even while she develops the transforming simile, the dream transport, with studious and exacting care. Masterful sentence structure carries the whole passage: for instance, the participle pouring, which at first seems expressionistic and strange, becomes lucid and naturalistic when repeated. This ending depicts a moment when the delineating power of language fails, as opposites of age and gender approach one another in a near epiphany. And yet the whole poem itself is about the power of words. --Peter Campion, PoetryAdmired in Ireland since the 1970s, Ni Chuilleanain...deserves American attention too. ...[D]rawn to visionary experience, yet alert to domestic and urban detail, she looks at once inward to things of the spirit and outward to coastlines, Continental Europe and an omnipresent sea. ... Her visionary sentences favor soft consonants and muffled stops, without rhyme: their tones vary from celebratory to bitter, from the openly prayerful to the curtly appalled. ... --Stephen Burt, The New York Times Book Review"}
{"description": "In over 40 years' work, German poet and cultural critic Enzenberger has captured the complex interlayerings of public and private realities, ultimately testifying to their difficult inseparability, their conflicts and contradictions. The product of the contrary forebears Bertolt Brecht and Gottfried Benn, among others, Enzenberger's poetry is a complex fusion of dramatic satire and meditative verse, quietly fixed on structures of oppression and coercion. Enzensbeger proceeds with intense, incisive portraits drawn as though by an inverse WhitmanAthe Pensioner, the Employee, the discreet Detective. This painterly method is often coupled with sometimes jarring transformations of figures and contexts, used not for the sake of aesthetics but for invoking moral consciousness, as in the early \"Poem about the Future, November 1964\": \"Two men appear on a tractor/ (Chou En-Lai is in Moscow)/ Two men in stone-grey overalls/ (Nobel Prize-winners in evening dress)/ Two men with slender sticks/ (gold medals from Tokyo)/ at the wayside amid yellow leaves/ (the dead guerillas of Vietnam)...\" The dangers of piety and self-righteousness are avoided by generous doses of self-indictment; Enzensbeger is a master of deflating senses of middle-class accomplishment, his own often foremost among them. The later work, particularly the new poems of Kiosk, gives way to a more philosophical, forgiving tone where observations and speculations on nature, evolution and mind are given freer reign: \"the thought/ behind the other thought./ A pebble, ordinary,/ homogeneous, hard,/ not for sale.\" The translations by varying hands are consistently clear, capturing the sharp, spare style. (The Selected includes the German.) Though the forms and focus of this poetry change over time, its intent and integrity remain consistent, as do its richness and clarity.

{"description": "Is Hill the greatest living English poet? Many critics (including Harold Bloom) have said as much, since the 1970s, when a few dense books inspired transatlantic admiration.

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "Kenneth Patchen (1911-1972) was one of the most prolific American poets of his time. He was born in Niles, Ohio. He attended school at the University of Madison-Wisconsin where he met his wife, Miriam Oikemus. They moved to Greenwich Village and befriended many writers including E.E. Cummings, Anais N&#xEF;n, and Henry Miller. An accident occurred after his first publication that would eventually leave him an invalid. He and his wife later moved to San Francisco during the early years of the Beat Movement. Many Beat poets would cite Patchen as a major influence. His \"experimental protests\" in poetry, painting, and prose remain unprecedented. Aside from his many books of poetry, his acclaimed novels, and his concrete visual works, Kenneth Patchen also collaborated with John Cage for the radio-play The City Wears a Slouch Hat, and worked with Charles Mingus developing jazz poetry. Patchen was an unwavering pacifist and many of his works have a political bent. Patchen was the first recipient of an NEA Literary Grant in 1967."}
{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "Khodasevich (1886&#x2013;1939) emerged during an astonishingly fertile period in Russian poetry, but unlike Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Pasternak, or Tsvetaeva, he has not attracted translators&#x2019; attention. Nabokov translated three of Khodasevich&#x2019;s poems, and in an obituary he wrote for one of the leading Russian &#xE9;migr&#xE9; journals, he called Khodasevich the &#x201C;greatest Russian poet of our time.&#x201D; This remark is repeated in Michael Wachtel&#x2019;s insightful introduction. This volume presents the Russian en face, and includes 12 pages of notes and a second introduction by the translator, Peter Daniels. All this associated material makes it clear that Khodasevich&#x2019;s verse is formal and allusive, constantly referring to the Russian poetic tradition, especially to Pushkin. Given that these strengths cannot be preserved in translation, it is remarkable how a distinct sensibility appears in Daniels&#x2019; admirable work. Daniels succeeds, mostly, in keeping to a rough approximation of Khodasevich&#x2019;s metrical rigor while preserving a sense of his rhyme schemes. At their best, these welcome translations hint at how magisterial the Russian must sound, and how strange: &#x201C;the quiet harmony of my hell / has been restored, and all is well.&#x201D; --Michael Autrey"}
{"description": "More than 100 years ago, Emily Dickinson wrote, \"It is the pain of a poem that comes first, and the form that follows.\" Here in Der-Hovanessian's selected work, pain is derived from the cultural dissolution of the war-eroded and occupied country of Armenia; it resonates in concise statements about a people seeking desperately to reestablish a sense of place. The poems address this necessity through the conventions of dreamwork, invocations of the dead, personae poems and through the speaker's firsthand reporting of facts. In those that work best, the poet conquers her tendency to employ repetition as a structural motif and rejects the temptations of regionalism for something more global. The poem \"Translating\" gracefully avoids both of these pitfalls, grappling instead with the real drama of a speaker's internal struggle to transform the unspoken language and images of the dead into an enduring vernacular. And the result, seen as well in the poems \"At Mt. Auburn Cemetery\" and \"Diaspora,\" is an admirable containment. The poems are also energized by the plaintive and mournful tones that course through them, voices bearing the message that something irreplaceable is about to be lost.Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.", "title": "Selected Poems"}
{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "Once he bestrode the American scene like a colossus, but while plenty of his work remains in print, Carl Sandburg (1878^-1967) is no longer much--or well--spoken of these days, especially as a poet. This new selection of his verse by two scholars, George and Willene Hendrick, who tracked down dozens of uncollected or unpublished Sandburg poems, may change that situation. It is superb, not a bum poem in it, even if one or another brings one up short with outdated slang or the use of the forbiddenn-word (for the record, few white public figures have been ardenter champions of blacks than Sandburg). The Hendricks present 166 poems in sections reflecting Sandburg's concerns: \"Chicago,\" \"Lincoln,\" \"African-Americans,\" \"Love Poems,\" \"Poems of Protest,\" etc. Sandburg's great inspiration was Whitman; no one else carried more of the tone and panhumanism ofLeaves of Grassinto the twentieth century than Sandburg. He was less spiritual and more political than Whitman, and his literary roots in urban reporting made for an imagery grittier, grayer, more documentary than Whitman's--an imagery, though, as striking, especially visually, as any that Sandburg's imagist peers--Amy Lowell, Pound, Williams--produced. Great stuff.Ray Olson"}

His \"Funeral Blues,\" a 16-line song about lost love, became a widespread favorite after its use in the filmFour Weddings and a Funeral; his \"Sept. 1, 1939\" (\"Those to whom evil is done/ Do evil in return\") seemed to be everywhere after September 11, 2001, as readers used its somber public voice to make sense of a senseless day. Mendelson&mdash;Auden's literary executor, and the man who knows more than anyone else alive about Auden's life and writings&mdash;has already assembled the standard books Auden fans know, among them an earlier 100-poemSelected, which included poems famous during Auden's life, such as \"Sept. 1\" and \"In Memory of W.B.

Mendelson now rectifies those faults, adds 17 more poems and amplifies his articulate preface, just in time for the centennial of Auden's birth.

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "Serious readers of contemporary poetry who agreed on nothing else could agree to admire Thom Gunn. When Gunn died, age 75, in 2004, critics in his native England remembered a tough young writer who gained fast fame in the 1950s, whose cool pentameters praised motorcycles and Elvis; Americans remembered the certainly learned, and yet perpetually youthful poet who made San Francisco his permanent home, a celebrant of gay life in the 1970s, and an elegist of HIV and AIDS in the 1990s, his extreme topics subjected to remarkable formal control. Kleinzahler (Sleeping It Off in Rapid City)-another San Francisco writer, and a friend of Gunn's for decades-has put together a slender, effective selection, from early set pieces (\"On the Move\") to midcareer retrospectives like \"Autobiography\" (\"The sniff of the real, that's/ what I'd want to get\") through the valedictory poems of Boss Cupid (2000), with its long-delayed, careful response to Gunn's mother's suicide. Gunn \"became more adventurous as he grew older,\" says Kleinzahler's avid introduction, and the whole of the poems bear him out. The introduction, and the choice among poems, emphasizes Gunn's adventurous range in technique-quatrains, trimeter stanzas, meticulous free verse, and so on-more than it shows his sometimes adventurous life: Gunn wrote of dance clubs, street protests, drugs, and sex, but also about grief, care and personal loyalty. Though the volume seems too brief, the whole of Gunn's power shines through. He could find many more readers now.Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "Since Sadness and Happiness (1975) Pinsky has rightly accumulated praise for his ambitious attempts to speak for America, traditional craft (iambic pentameters, couplet rhymes), and careful use of his own life. Pinsky's mentally ill mother, his extended family, and their urban Jewish roots inform many poems, though he ends up not so much confessional as representative, devoted to an American melting pot. This first selected in 14 years from the former U.S. poet laureate contains no new poems; it begins with recent work: a poem in the form of a prayer invokes a \"Holy One who loves blood sacrifice/ And burnt offerings, commerce and the Arts\"; \"Rhyme\" depicts \"all the unsteady/ Chambered voices that share it,/ Each reciting I too was here.\" That sense of an American gathering extends throughout the volume, into the angry political poems of Gulf Music (2007), a reference to Hurricane Katrina, through the prose blocks of \"An Alphabet of My Dead,\" and back to what may still be Pinsky's most famous poem, the book-length An Explanation of America (1979), excerpted here, whose clearly argued triads of blank verse compared the United States after Vietnam to the republic in earlier days&mdash;and to imperial Rome.

{"description": "Starred Review. A virtuoso of rhyming form, a master of puns and a subtle verse autobiographer, Merrill (1926-1995) got attacked during his lifetime as too fancy or artful. He is now generally considered one of his generation's greats. Readers prize his gemlike early lyrics; his autobiographical poems of friendship, illness, privilege (his father cofounded Merrill Lynch), travel (Greece, New England, Florida) and same-sex love; his science-fictional epicThe Changing Light at Sandover(written with help from a Ouija board); and the rueful, reflective, sometimes very funny poems of his last years, from \"Rhapsody on Czech Themes\" to \"b o d y\" (\"Looked at too long, words fail,/ phase out\").

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "Starred Review.Proving there are still plenty of poetic miles left in rhythm and rhyme, as well as in Larkinesque cynicism, this career-spanning collection offers an introduction to the work of a leading British poet and former professor of poetry at Oxford. Love and menace are the principal muses for Fenton's dark wit. Whether describing how an ex is safe because she's no longer loved (\"What belongs to the wind and rain/ Is out of danger from the storm\") or narrating war's awful arithmetic (\"One man shall wake from terror to his bed/ Five men shall be dead\"), the control behind these lines is often terrifying. Many of the most powerful poems memorialize the lingering effects of war. Fenton has a knack for capturing awful thoughts and moments, which one wants to forget but can't:\"...he forgot to say to me/ How an honest man should die.\" There's also a punch to the love poems; in one singsong piece, a husband commands his wife to be happy, or he'll leave. Also included is the libretto forThe Love Bomb,in which a woman leaves her lover for a cult, then tries to recruit him.

{"title": "Selected Poems", "description": "This career-spannning retrospective, culled from nearly 50 years of work, will go a long way toward reminding readers of the breadth and depth of Nobel laureate Walcott's achievement. Though he is perhaps best known for his modern epic,Omeros, which tells a Homeric tale set in St. Lucia, Walcott is a fine lyric poet as well, writing in traditional forms and meters as well as in powerful free verse. Alongside the epic tone that he brought into modern verse&mdash;\"I sing of Achille, Afolabe's son,/ who never ascended in an elevator\"&mdash;is lustful writing about a woman humming Bob Marley on a bus, a casual description of being mugged in Greenwich Village or a painter's-eye view of a fish. The political Walcott is also here; observing a crowd listening to a politician, he writes, \"Who will name this silence/ respect? Those forced, hoarse hosannas/ awe?\" The lyric Walcott is well represented, but the long poems&mdash;which are necessarily excerpted&mdash;prove more problematic. At best, the editor can hope that readers, hooked by one of these narrative poems, will be compelled to seek out the complete version. Nonetheless, this book represents a milestone in the career of a major writer.(Jan.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."}

His marvelous poems are simultaneously deeply serious and deeply playful. They are animated by a powerful desire to acknowledge, express, and understand the self in all its messy, unliterary, and often unflattering particularity; by an equally strong distrust of most conventional forms of understanding, of acknowledgment and expression; and by a distrust that often manifests itself as wordplay, ironic undercutting and tonal shifts. At all times musically engaging, his work is unsettling and powerfully moving, a combination of effects I ve found in no one else s poetry. This book is a gift to anyone who loves and cares about American poetry. --Alan Shapiro --Alan ShapiroI first read the poems in Wilmer Mills sLight for the Orphansa decade ago, struck by their combination of finely-honed versecraft with rare depth and complexity of feeling.

That we will have no more poems in Wil Mills s searching, tender, troubled, and wise voice is a great loss.

{"description": "Grade 6-10&ndash;When 15-year-old Lucy's father dies, her family learns that he was deeply in debt and that they can no longer afford their upper-middle-class lifestyle. Within just a few months, they find themselves living in a shelter. Lucy must leave her private school and attend a public school in a rough neighborhood, where she feels grateful to be lost in the crowd so that she can keep her circumstances a secret. She takes care of her younger brother, pushes her mother to go to school and be sociable, gets a job, makes friends with other residents at the shelter, and tracks down her estranged aunt. By the end of the book, Lucy's family has regained some semblance of their former life. While this novel addresses a difficult social problem, it is somewhat unrealistic as, in the end, things work out well for almost everybody. Lucy's mother gets a job and meets a new man, Lucy finds a boyfriend, and friends from the shelter find jobs and move to better apartments. While this is not great literature, its appealing characters and smoothly flowing plot make it a satisfying read.&ndash;Janet Hilbun, Texas Woman's University, DentonCopyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "Rarely have prayers to Krishna sounded so serene and so sensual at the same time. This is the fourth album from Rasa, the duo of singer Kim Waters and multi-instrumentalistHans Christian. Overall, there's little to differentiate this disc from the other three. Waters sings Indian chants and prayers in a voice that is soothing and serene, like velvet smoke curling around these adapted melodies. Using sophisticated programming, cello, electric bass, Indian sarangi, and Swedish nyckelharpa, Christian embeds her voice in translucent layers. Each time he touches an instrument, adding it to his textured arrangements, it's like unlocking the key to a serpentine journey. He also brings the rhythms slightly to the fore, reinforcing the tablas of Girish Gambhira with subtle electronica grooves. But there's no thud-thud, four-on-the-floor sell-out to a dance music subset. Waters's voice is so serene and the grooves so relentlessly languid thatShelterbecomes like a long bath.

{"description": "The Shimano SH-M088 Shoes provides the streamlined shape and power transfer of traditional cross-country shoes, only with some added walk'ability and traction for traversing unruly terrain. After all, most aspiring mountain bikers have to cut their teeth on trail systems that're really just tenuously linked networks of boulder-strewn fall lines and deer trails. Shimano offers one of the widest ranges of shoe lasts (or shapes) in the industry. So, to clarify, the SH-M088 uses the Volume Plus last for a wider and more accommodating fit in the toe box, with a normal fit over the rest of the shoe. To secure the foot, the M088 uses the tried-and-true system of one micro-adjust buckle and two Velcro straps. The buckle can be mounted in two different positions, ensuring comfort whether you have a high or low instep. The Velcro straps over the forefoot are offset to prevent pinching and pressure. The M088 shoes have a fiberglass-reinforced, polyamide sole that's stiff, yet it flexes enough for comfortable walking. The durable rubber tread also provides plenty of traction for hikes over hellish terrain or to escort your beyond-trail-repair rig out of the woods. The upper is constructed of tough, stretch-resistant synthetic leather, and mesh inserts throughout provide plenty of breathability for hot summer rides.", "title": "Shimano 2014 Men's Off-Road Sport Cycling Shoes - SH-M088L"}
{"description": "The deeper that we get into Shimano's new line of cycling shoes, the more that we start to wonder, 'where's the entry-level?' Simply by going in order, the new SH-R088 Shoes fall second in the catalog. However, it retains key features from Shimano shoes well above it. Shimano had one key objective for its SH-R088 shoes: meeting comfort with quality. And not surprisingly, Shimano did not disappoint. The R088s feature a fiberglass-reinforced polyamide outsole construction that strikes the ideal balance between rigidity and comfort. Now, we're all led to believe that stiffer is better, and in some cycling applications, this is absolutely true. However, it's crucial to remember that over the course of a century, that overly rigid shoe will degrade your circulation. So, to avoid the eventual numbing, Shimano developed what it calls its Dynalast technology. This outsole system delivers power to the pedal, while still allowing a calculated level of flex. This is possible due to the sole's variable stiffness and density that accommodates the movements of the arch. Furthering this power transfer are the R088's securing straps. The shoes feature two hook-and-loop straps that allow you to control the shoes' internal volume. Shimano has given these a broad and offset design that makes them simple to grab and adjust while in the saddle, should you need to make any on-the-fly adjustments. Controlling the overall tightness and security is a Shimano micro-adjust, ratcheting buckle. This system allows you make incremental adjustments with an elongated ratchet fixture. And when examining all three straps, it becomes obvious that they all work in unison with the R088's anatomic last design. For the uppers, Shimano used a stretch-resistant, synthetic leather for the support structure. This material is similar to other high-end synthetics in that it's more durable, lighter weight, and better to look at than traditional leather. To keep your feet cool, Shimano placed ultralight ope...", "title": "Shimano SH-R088 Road Shoes"}

{"description": "Mary Black's first seven solo albums were all recorded in Ireland, with producer Declan Sinnott crafting a fine balance between Celtic folk music and international pop--and every one of them climbed to the top of the Irish charts. It was a successful formula but it was becoming a bit predictable, so Black decided to cut her eighth album,Shine, in Los Angeles with Joni Mitchell's longtime collaborator Larry Klein as producer. As might be expected, there are fewer Irish folk flavors in the music and more L.A. singer-songwriter influences. The results, though, don't resemble Mitchell's cutting-edge folk-jazz so much as Linda Ronstadt's adult-contemporary pop.Black remains a special singer; her husky mezzo manages to be intimate and powerful at the same time. She's not a songwriter, however, so she's utterly dependent on her material. Unfortunately,Shineis dominated by the sort of melodramatic melodies and sentimental lyrics that might have been intended for Celine Dion. Black isn't guilty of Dion's over-the-top bombast, but Black can't inject much subtlety into simple-minded songs that urge us to &quot;Shine&quot; and enlighten us that &quot;Nobody Lives Without Love.&quot; It's only when Black returns to the work of such proven songwriters as Richard Thompson (&quot;I Misunderstood&quot;) and Paul Brady (&quot;I Will Be There&quot;) that she reminds us what a dramatic interpreter she can be.--Geoffrey Himes", "title": "Shine"}

{"description": "When you listen to this collection of nearly all the noteworthy singles by the Smiths, you might marvel over the fact thatMorrisseyand guitarist Johnny Marr collaborated and cowrite so many astonishing tunes only to break up a mere four years into their creative burst. The first half ofSinglesis a relentless parade of top-notch emotional Morrissey punches. Then just when you think you're going to catch your breath, \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" breaks out and the poignancy and wit of that charming man really hits home. From the shimmering \"Ask\" to the dark crooner \"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\" to the closing hit \"There is a Light That Never Goes Out,\" the collection leaves one feeling wistful, for these tracks will never be matched.--Lorry Fleming", "title": "Singles"}

{"title": "Solo", "description": "Born in Philadelphia on July 22, 1953, Jimmy Bruno was first exposed to music by his parents at a very early age. His mother was a singer and his father, Jimmy Bruno, Sr., was a notable jazz guitarist who was best known for his performance in 1959 on the hit recording \"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\" with Frank Virtue and the Virtues. When Bruno was about eight his childhood love for music began to develop when his father brought home what would be Jimmy&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s first guitar. As a child, he never had any formal training, but instead absorbed the life altering sounds of Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, John Coltrane and Oscar Peterson.In 1973, when Bruno was just nineteen, he landed his first big gig when Buddy Rich came to Philly holding auditions for a guitarist. He spent the next year on the road with Buddy, receiving quite a musical education. When he returned to Philadelphia in 1974, he found few gigs as a jazz musician and decided to try his luck playing in Las Vegas, finally settling in Los Angeles as a studio musician. In the end it wasn&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;t the place or the music he loved. Since his return to Philly in 1988, Jimmy Bruno has created a name that is synonymous with jazz guitar, recording numerous albums for Concord Records and now for Mel Bay Records.In addition to his new album with Mel Bay Records, Jimmy Bruno has recently been featured in three, live concert DVDs released through Mel Bay Records - Jimmy Bruno: Live at Chris&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99; Caf&#xC3;&#xA9;, Volumes 1 and 2 and Jimmy Bruno and Jack Wilkins: Live at The Theatre. Jimmy is also a Mel Bay author who to date has written several instructional books for six and seven string jazz guitar.

First up, Michael Tait explores relationships in a couple of pop-rock tunes that line up with mainstream top-10 lists. Next, Kmax shoots at funky aesthetics with his poetry-thick brand of art pop. These songs provide substance for those with a taste for the eclectic. Finally, McKeehan delivers a hip-hop/rap-core experience with an undeniableLimp Bizkitinfluence.

{"description": "Don McLean's final album for United Artists was a musical tour de force, and the best self-contained account of the full breadth of McLean's talent. Recorded live in England, in Manchester, Bristol, London, and Oxford, the 26 songs encompassed not only the artist's best-known work, but also many of his personal favorites, among them works by other composers (including Bob Dylan's \"Masters of War\"). All the songs are done solo by McLean on acoustic guitar and banjo, performing in a loose, freewheeling style more appropriate to a folk performance at a small club than a rock concert -- except that McLean was doing these performances to tens of thousands of people at a time. He ranges freely across his repertory, including a loose yet sincere rendition of \"American Pie\" and a stunning version of \"Till Tomorrow\" (his encore), through \"The Arkansas Traveller\" and \"Homeless Brother\" to \"Castles in the Air,\" the last in a version that makes the studio recording seem cold and sterile. Ironically, given that it's one of the best records he ever put out and a great capstone to his career at United Artists, Solo was the only album he ever did for the label that never charted, in either England or America, possibly because it was a double-LP and very expensive, and was also issued just late enough into the 1970s to run into the twin juggernauts of punk and disco. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide", "title": "Solo"}
{"description": "Egberto Gismonti is a musician of extraordinary facility--a guitarist with a highly evolved, personal technique, as well as a fine pianist. But his work is further distinguished by its emotional depths, its grace, its sense of drama, and its extraordinary sonic beauty. On this solo recording, he creates unusually intimate music, integrating folk instruments and songs with his 8-string guitar and piano. On the 20-minute opening track, he presents a long polyphonic guitar piece, followed by the beautiful \"Pau Rolou,\" which combines his voice with \"cooking bells\" for sustained metallic tones. \"And Zero\" and \"Frevo\" are piano pieces imbued with a unique lyricism. The former has a lightDebuss y-like touch that seems to dance across water; the latter is a modal piece performed with percussive force. \"Salvador\" has him returning to the guitar, the piece suggesting the richness of the Spanish guitar tradition. The final \"Ciranda Nordestina\" combines piano with more of the cooking bells, which resemble the bells used in some Asian ceremonies. Gismonti sets out to capture the breadth of his Brazilian experience, but in so doing, he touches on much of the music of the world, from Mediterranean dance music to the scales and rhythms of the Middle East and Moorish Spain to the resonant space of temple and rain forest.--Stuart Broomer", "title": "Solo"}
{"description": "\"I felt the necessity to create an album of secrets, letters and notes, and photos. Something like an aural diary,\" writes Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the liner notes ofSolo, his first proper solo effort in two decades. Indeed, much of the disc plays like a hushed homage to moods, thoughts, feelings, and ideas, anchored by Rubalcaba richly emotive piano work. The pianist earned much of his acclaim via collaborations with groups and has worked with bassists Charlie Haden, Ron Carter and saxophonist Joe Lovano.Solo, however, finds Rubalcaba soaring on the strength of his own talent. Kick-off interlude \"Rezo (Praise Be)\" is based on Afro-Cuban melodies sung during Santeria rites, and \"Silencio\" is a moving bolero tribute. Rubalcaba has include material here that he has previously recorded--including the standard \"Besame Mucho\"--but he reworks it, giving the songs a fresh urgency.Soloalso includes four improvisations (\"Paseo Iluminado,\" \"Paseo en Media Luz,\" \"Paseo Azul\" and \"Paseo Morado\") that mark the passing of a single day via environmental light. That free-form quartet was inspired by John Coltrane's \"Giant Steps,\" but Rubalcaba manages to make them, and the rest ofSolo, a wholly unique experience.--Joey Guerra", "title": "Solo"}

{"description": "Queen's American stock may have fallen somewhat in the 1980s. By following singer Freddie Mercury's lead and embracing more club- and cabaret-oriented music, however, the band saw its international appeal explode. During that era, Mercury also launched a promising solo career that produced two wildly disparate albums, a handful of singles, and contributions to other projects that are documented in this three-disc collection. While 1985's \"Mr. Bad Guy\" finds Mercury's melodramatic vocal flair struggling to overpower his sometimes patchy songwriting and the dated Euro-disco production of Reinhold Mack, the singer rose to the campy heights of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"--and then some--on \"Barcelona,\" his grand, neo-operatic collaboration with Spanish divaMontserrat Caballeand one of the most deliriously ambitious pop albums of modern times. Both are available here in sharp, digitally remastered sound.

The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, \"Speed on in your Speedos.\" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn&rsquo;t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it&rsquo;s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today.

His mother, the legendary British actress Diana Lancaster, delivers a breathtaking performance as the lead, although she's been suffering excruciating headaches. Alas, she dies just before opening night--the first in a series of melodramatically timed demises that claim so many of the characters here.

This is simple declarative account of a man abandoned by the great love of his life. He reflects upon his loss, expresses his fears and desires, and searches the heavens for solace. He finds some and gives thanks. The band (Nelson backed by fiddle, piano, and second guitar) plays a wistful waltz and life goes on, though the end is in sight. The Willie ofRed-Headed Strangerwas wild and dangerous when he was hurt; the Willie ofSpiritis reflective and contrite. Still,Spiritranks withRed-Headed Stranger,one of the landmarks in modern country music history.--Steven Stolder"}

{"title": "Spirit", "description": "Imagine Pink Floyd'sDark Side of the Moonwith a Native American motif and you have a fair gauge of Peter Buffett's intentions onSpirit, a live recording of a 1998 stage production involving more than 80 drummers, dancers, and musicians. (Originally aired on public television,Spiritis now on video.) Most of Buffett's keyboard-driven, percussion-fueled compositions are live renderings of works from his intriguing 1997 release,Spirit Dance, his most recent ode to Native culture. The energized live setting (at times involving a female youth choir, Native American singers, Native American flutistRobert Mirabal, and, impressively, guitarist Peter Maunu) serves Buffett's atmospheric work well as it traces a theme of personal transformation guided by Native spirits.Spiritmay not fully match the sustained sensory impact of Pink Floyd's opus, but it offers several riveting moments--the percussion-heavy reworking of \"Firedance,\" his brief contribution to Kevin Costner's filmDances with Wolves, the exultant \"Passage,\" and a lost gem from Buffett's catalog, the plaintive, piano-based \"New West.\"--Terry Wood"}
{"description": "It's time for an update of our image of Jewel, the ingenue who set the music world on fire with her 1995 debut album,Pieces of You. After all, that effort consisted primarily of songs Jewel had written several years before, some of them dating back to her days as a free- spirited waif living in a van on the beach in San Diego. Now, at 25, she's become a sort of guru for self-expression and full disclosure, revealing perhaps too much of herself in see-through dresses worn to awards shows and a critically drubbed (yet bestselling)book of poetry.Spiritmakes plain why Jewel's well-intentioned yet sometimes facile lyrics strike a chord with her audience while her poetry lies flat on the page. On songs like \"Deep Water,\" \"Hands,\" and \"Down So Long,\" her words are borne aloft by sparkling melodies and her soaring voice, making even the most cynical observer take a schoolgirl-notebook image such as \"your heart like grape gum on the ground\" or an unreassuring platitude like \"If I could tell the world just one thing / It would be that we're all OK\" somewhat in stride. OnPieces of You, Jewel posed the musical question \"Who will save your soul?\" OnSpirit, it sounds like she wants to do it herself. And the truth is, if you don't overanalyze it, the album does act as a sort of balm for wounded psyches or maybe a primer for raising your own inner child. Maybe she's right and weareall OK.

{"description": "Just named The Official Towel of the Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association, YogaRat's SportLite Towels are not only great for yoga practice but also for home, gym, beach, outdoors, and travel. Highly absorbent and ultra-fast-drying, these lint-free towels are available in three sizes: Hand+Face towels come 2 IN A PACK (2 for the price of one!), and are the perfect small-sized towel to keep next to your yoga mat, in your golf bag, in your kitchen, or any place a larger towel is unnecessary. Medium-sized Sport+Bath towels are the size of standard bath towels and are a great way to dry off after a morning surf session, a hard workout at the gym, or after a shower. Large-sized Beach+Pool towels will barely take up a corner of your backpack or carry bag, won't trap sand, and dry so fast it's like having a fresh towel every time you need to dry off. All SportLite Towels are great for hiking and travel, as they take up much less space than terry towels when packed. They are made of super-absorbent microfiber that's incredibly soft to the touch, machine washable/dryable (wash cold with like colors, no bleach or fabric softener; tumble dry low) and extremely durable. And since they take up a fraction of the volume of their terry counterparts, they save space, water, and energy when it's laundry time. Each towel includes a perfectly placed sewn-in hang loop that makes it a breeze to hang from a hook, for even faster drying. SportLite Towels: towels with a whole new Rattitude!

{"title": "Sweet Dreams", "description": "Perhaps seeking to replenish its artist roster with fresh piano talent following the recent departure of David Lanz, Narada brings us a full-length debut recording from Taiwan native Mia Jang, an artist first introduced to the public on a 1996 label sampler of unsigned pianists (First Light). Jang, who once studied at Taipei's Chinese Culture University under Yo-Yo Ma's father, now resides in the States and composes music unadorned with any noticeable cultural influences. Her 14 piano solos, pieces that had their origin as bedtime confections for her young children, are almost uniformly quiet, reflective, earnestly melodic, and easily digested. Jang perfumes her impressionistic compositions with a gentle spirit that endows them with an essence of instant familiarity; though to her credit, her musical structures convey an intelligence that elevates these pieces a notch above typical lullaby fare. In Jang's world, your dreams will be sweet, not sugar-coated.--Terry Wood"}

{"title": "Sweet Dreams", "description": "Tommy McLain is such a phenomenal vocalist it's easy to see how this unknown artist's version of \"Sweet Dreams\" beat out Don Gibson's and Patsy Cline's renditions in the pop market. Granted, Gibson and Cline were country -- not pop -- stars, but neither one was a stranger to the pop charts. McLain's piano-triplet ballad style has more in common with earlier Louisiana singers like Jimmy Clanton than the prevailing pop sounds of the day, and in fact sounds pretty retro for the late '60s. Sweet Dreams contains McLain's sole hit and 19 other recordings from 1966-1969, encompassing R&B; and country covers that include several recordings of songs by fellow Louisiana artists like Jimmy C. Newman and Fats Domino, with a particular emphasis on Domino. McLain dipped into the Don Gibson songbook again for \"I'd Be a Legend in My Time,\" but was unable to recapture the spark of \"Sweet Dreams.\" In fact, McLain never managed to place another single on the national charts despite being a talented vocalist, instrumentalist, and occasional songwriter.

Away from her friends and the prestigious dance camp in which she has earned a spot, the 16-year-old wonders how she will stay connected to what has gotten her through the recent loss of her mother. But when she meets her Amish neighbors, she is immediately intrigued by handsome Noah; for the first time in ages, grief and depression are replaced by something much more life-affirming. Although equally attracted, Noah is not free to date Rose. In fact, he is forbidden to be alone with her. Still, both feel a connection that is too intense to ignore and find ways to be together. Readers are exposed to the beliefs, joys, and frustrations of both teens through their alternating points of view. However, as romantic as the story may be, it is hard to connect to Noah. Though he is a charming, skilled worker who is respected as an adult in his community and knows what he wants despite the risks, he is set in his beliefs and refuses to leave his Amish community-forcing sassy, smart, and modern Rose to give up everything to live an Amish life, a sacrifice that is hard to accept.-Jennifer Miskec, Longwood University, Farmville, VA&#x3B1;(c) Copyright 2011.

{"description": "In 1909 New York City, Temperance O'Neil is an upper class intellectual  exploring the few public forums allowed her: the campaign against the tenements  and the emancipation of women. When her stepfather, Angus McCairn, demands that  Temperance move to Scotland to begin a more proper life, she is stuck. Dependent  on his control of her money, Temperance moves to Scotland but makes his life a  circus of women's committees and good works. To distract her, Angus makes an  irresistible offer--once she has found a wife for his reclusive nephew, James,  she may return to New York with a modest stipend. Temperance agrees, and heads  for the remote laird.Once Temperance arrives, however, she realizes that the challenge of finding  James a wife is equally as intimidating as the prospect of cleaning up a  tenement. The house is in shambles, the local town depressed, and his welcome  perfectly horrible. Faced with this task or the return to her stepfather,  Temperance digs in and focuses all her energies on making James presentable and  finding a willing bride. Impressed by her tenacity, James begins to care for  her, and it looks like the search for a wife may be over, if Temperance  agrees.Temperance is the heroine we've been waiting for. The descendent of Jane  Austen's women, she is smart, passionate, liberated, and true to her own ideals.  While at the denouement of most stories the heroine melts into a slushy pile of  self-contradictions, Deveraux's character stands strong in her convictions and  wins the respect of the readers, if not her fellow characters. Just like the  readers, romance heroines are securing the man, the fortune, and the good ending  through the quality of their characters, and not by the leverage of their  charms. Temperance is the hero that we all want to be, and Jude Deveraux's work  is an entertaining medium for inspiration.--Nancy R.E. O'Brien", "title": "Temptation"}

{"title": "Temptation", "description": "Only after leaving Nashville did Shelby Lynne reinvent herself as a soulful R&B; singer. During her Music City days of the early '90s, she gained critical raves that didn't translate into wider success. One reason was this fetching 1993 Nashville-produced album of big-band Western swing, produced by Brent Maher, which appeared long before the wordsswing revivalcrossed anyone's lips. It revealed Lynne's assets in a stronger showcase than her earlier Epic recordings. She's radiant and sensual on the torchy \"Little Unlucky at Love,\" but the uninhibited swing tunes, including her explosive performance of the title number, defined the album. She maintained that finger-popping momentum with \"Some of That True Love\" and \"The Rain Might Wash Your Love Away.\" Lynne turned seductress on \"Tell Me I'm Crazy\" and honky-tonker on \"I Need a Heart to Come Home To,\" the album's most overtly country number. Now that Lynne's gained wider exposure, it's worth remembering that pushing the envelope is nothing new for her.--Rich Kienzle"}

Still featuring an 8 panel construction for a professional fit, the Viper Shorts have been designed with medium to long distance riding in mind. We are using a brand new superior professional moulded foam pad in a vibrant Orange colour. The new pad is a 3 layer multi density construction, which gives wider and longer coverage in the saddle areas. The depth is an impressive 15 mm at the rear, tapering to a modest 8 mm at the front. The pad features an over-locking stitch construction all the way around the edge to prevent chafing. In other words, the pad edges are sealed flat so there are no harsh edges to rub against your skin.This thoroughly modern and striking design features vibrant contrast colour stitching options in Yellow, Orange and Blue. Our plain Black option is just as impressive. With safety in mind for low light conditions, we have introduced strikingly reflective heat transfers on the rear of both legs, along with our manufacturer's logo which will get you noticed.The fabric is the same high quality as our standard 8 Panel Shorts options, with 20% Spandex to allow the fabric to stretch in four directions in the right areas. These are technically designed for serious cyclists, allowing the shorts more curvature offering the cyclist better performance and comfort. Flat stitched seams again prevent chafing while riding. Silicone leg grippers prevent the garment riding up the leg, while the blend of high density Nylon and Spandex fibres ensure that your muscles are kept insulated, supported and ready for action. Mens shorts are available in various sizes and colours.", "title": "Tenn 8 Panel Viper Professional Cycling Shorts with Superior Pad"}

{"description": "Little (The Association) displays his darker side in the 32 mostly memorable stories that comprise this collection of unpublished and previously published stories. Drawing from a bizarre cauldron of influences (cited in brief introductions to each piece), Little tackles some disturbing topics, including pedophilia, family crucifixions, incest and bestiality. Indeed, even fans accustomed to the gore found in Little's novels may be taken aback by the manner in which characters carry out their fetishes and crimes. The main character in \"Blood,\" for example, kills both little boys and grown men without remorse, believing that his macaroni and cheese craves human blood. The supernatural and the unexplained are common themes, but some plot lines are underdeveloped. In \"Monteith,\" readers are left to ponder what would have happened had the main character confronted his wife about a one-word note - written in her hand - that turned his life upside down. Among Little's best offerings are \"Bob,\" a chilling tale of mistaken identity, and \"Pillow Talk,\" a witty yet sad story about bed linens that come to life and ultimately display more human traits than many of the characters in this collection. A fascinating glimpse into how Little's creativity has evolved over the years, this volume is a must-have for the author's fans despite its uneven nature.Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.", "title": "The Collection"}

{"description": "Is there anything that simply screams the 1970s' most indelible pop cultural clich&eacute;s--the sunny romanticism, perfect vocal hooks, feathered hair, stacked heels, and flared sateen britches--more than the Swedish pop phenomenon Abba? And while many a pundit snootily dismissed them during their prime as some sort of prefabricated aberration, their worldwide popularity peaked somewhere just south of Beatlesmania. Indeed, Abba's music was as finely tooled and crafted as anything to come from a Volvo or IKEA factory--if occasionally more economically potent. This double-disc, 37-track anthology comes neatly on the heels ofMama Mia!, the smash, if unlikely, Broadway show based on the band's hits, and documents every single released by the band's Polar label in their home country as well as key tracks released internationally.This is the canon from whence the term \"Europop\" sprang. With a continental sense of vocal neoclassicism, informed by just the right ethnic clich&eacute;s (and oft wed to the era's insistent 4/4 disco beat) to make songs like \"Mama Mia,\" \"Fernando,\" \"Chiquitita,\" and \"Voulez-Vous\" work on a global scale, the writing team of Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson and their respective partners in music and life, Agnetha Faltskog and Frida Lyngstad, developed the seamless, wall-of-sound productions contained herein.The Definitive Collectionfeatures a rare single remix of \"Ring, Ring\" and a 1979 promo-only extended mix of \"Voulez-Vous\" as bonus tracks, as well as a concise, illustrated history of the band and each track.--Jerry McCulley", "title": "The Definitive Collection"}

{"description": "Ahern wades into the Christmas fiction fray with a winning tale of magic and redemption. Lou Suffern is a busy man, and his family's growing weary of constantly taking the backseat to his career. On a whim, he offers Gabe, a homeless man he meets outside his office, a low-level job, and the uncharacteristically kind gesture plays out in a very unexpected way when Lou learns that Gabe has the power to be in two places at once. As the holidays draw nearer, Gabe tries to make Lou realize the importance of his family, but slow-to-change Lou might not come around to Gabe's way of thinking until it's too late. Ahern's an accomplished storyteller, and her writing chops elevate this far above the normal holiday fare.

{"description": "Album of the week  &#xB7;  traditional  THE GIFT/Corrinne May  Pink Armchair  ***  THE odds are frankly stacked against her.  She does not have the cute pop packaging of Stefanie Sun nor the febrile quote-worthiness of Tanya Chua, yet Corrinne May has become one of Singapore's most celebrated artistes without much hype.  Such is her appeal, the Los Angeles-based musician sells out gigs whenever she returns home.  Why? I'm no hardcore fan but listening to her third and latest album, The Gift, one gets her special allure.  It's that pristine presence of hers; an unadulterated generosity of spirit that permeates her songs and disarms the most hardened of souls.  Even hipsters who prefer cool street acts might think twice before dismissing her caramel pop souffle.  For her third album, a Christimas CD titled The Gift, she presents nine carols and two originals all delivered with unflappable, down-home cool.  Remember Scrooged, that Bill Murray vehicle in which the actor experienced visitations by ghosts of Christmas past? This would make a perfect soundtrack to be played in the background as the lead got a reality check.  Indeed, the whole effect is to calm and lull you into heavenly bliss as the singer pours her caramel love over a seamless braiding of piano, guitar and almost-there percussion.  Her magic is how she makes everything - from classics like Silent Night and O Come All Ye Faithful to an original Hail Mary (with music put to words from the Gospel of Luke and a traditional prayer) - sound incredibly intimate.  In short, she is what you may call the Asian Amy Grant of lush pop, a contemporary Christian chanteuse who makes you feel good, and think good thoughts, too. --The Straits Times", "title": "The Gift"}

{"description": "For most of his life, Vladimir Nabokov was quite literally a man without a country. It's a small irony, then, that his career falls so neatly into national phases: Russian, German, French, and American, plus the protracted coda he spend in a Swiss luxury hotel during his final decade.The Gift, which he wrote between 1935 and 1937 in Berlin, is the grand summation of his second phase. It describes, for starters, the sentimental education of a young Russian writer, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev. This hyphenated creation has more than a few things in common with the author, despite Nabokov's vehement denial in the novel's foreword. Still, only a nitwit would readThe Giftfor its autobiographical revelations. What this early masterpiecedoesoffer is a wealth of lyrical, witty, heartbreaking prose, beautifully translated from the Russian byMichael Scammell(with an assist from Nabokov himself). Who else would note the way a street rises \"at a barely perceptible angle, beginning with a post office and ending with a church, like an epistolary novel\"? Who else has ever administered the satirical shiv to his characters with such deadly, almost affectionate aplomb?Shirin himself was a thickset man with a reddish crew cut, always badly shaved and wearing large spectacles behind which, as in two aquariums, swam two tiny, transparent eyes--which were completely impervious to visual impressions. He was blind like Milton, deaf like Beethoven, and a blockhead to boot.Of course, only a fraction ofThe Giftis taken up with this sort of demolition derby. Fyodor's romance with Zina, for example, occasions the most ardent prose of Nabokov's career: \"And not only was Zina cleverly and elegantly made to measure for him by a very painstaking fate, but both of them, forming a single shadow, were made to the measure of something not quite comprehensible, but wonderful and benevolent and continuously surrounding them.\" (Shades of Volodya and V&eacute;ra? Only the deceased husband and wife, and perhapsStacy Schiff, know for sure.)At the same time,The Giftis a brilliant, mesmerizing riff on the history of Russian literature, with elaborate bouquets tossed toPushkinandGogol. There's also a hilarious yet somehow tender evisceration of the do-gooding polemicistNikolai Chernyshevski--which was suppressed, in fact, when the novel was originally serialized by a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; magazine. As should be clear by now,The Giftdefies any attempt at quick-and-dirty summary. But the book plays the most pleasurable kind of havoc with our stuffy notions of narrative structure and linguistic protocol. And as Nabokov repeatedly wraps the reader's consciousness around his little finger, he never holds back on that ultimate literary gift: pleasure.--James Marcus", "title": "The Gift"}
{"title": "The Gift", "description": "Grade 2&#8211;6&#8212;Few picture books follow a protagonist from death to burial as in this poetic tale. A girl picnicking with her family long ago outside a small village wishes to be buried in her favorite clearing. An old woman appears who says the girl shall have her unspoken wish if she will only give her the flower chain she is weaving. The girl does so, returns to her family, and grows into an artist, wife, mother, and grandmother. When she is old, she expresses her wish to be buried in the clearing, which she has visited and tended throughout her life, and her wish comes true. Most remarkable are the illustrations, hand cut from single sheets of paper and spray painted, one color per spread, and then photographed. Intricate floral details in a folk-art style capture the girl's artistic spirit and the sunlight and flowers that grace the clearing. Despite the burial wish, this really is a story about a life well lived, but it may require some hand-selling to find an appreciative audience.&#8212;Julie R.

It's 1952, and the Whittakers are the perfect happy family. But when five-year-old Annie dies of meningitis the day after Christmas, their lives fall apart. Teenager Tommy begins frequenting a diner where he meets 16-year-old waitress Maribeth Robertson, who's pregnant and has been thrown out of her home. The two lonely adolescents slowly fall in love; Tommy offers to marry Maribeth, but she refuses, claiming that they are too young to be parents; she plans to give the child up for adoption. Meanwhile, Tommy's parents have drifted far apart, but the fear that their son may soon be a father temporarily reunites them. Eventually, the Whittakers, parents and son, help Maribeth to cope with her pregnancy and her family's rejection, while she helps them accept the death of their beloved Annie. Reading more like a novella than a full-fledged novel, the narrative has well-meaning characters, uplifting sentiments and a few moments that could make a stone weep.

Fourteen years later and now a pirate, Nathan wishes to claim his bride--and the property that comes with her--but the Winchesters aren't cooperating.

Despite it all, her determined affection for and faith in Nathan and his crew gradually wins her a place in their crusty, seafaring souls and a loyalty that is tested when, on their return to London, Sara's father threatens to expose an old scandal that could ruin the St. James name.Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc."}

{"description": "From Bruce M. King&#8217;s Introduction toThe Iliad&#160;The Iliad, then, even as it sings the immortality of its heroes, suggests an end to their imagined era and to the political order that is located there. Indeed, one of the great feats of theIliadis to pose a critique&#151;centered upon the withdrawals and speeches of Achilles&#151;of the heroic order and the possibilities that it offers for mortal happiness. From this point of view, the essential work of theIliadis one of negation&#151;again, the epic is unjust with respect to the old, but potentially beneficent with respect to the future. The old heroic order&#151;for all its blinding beauties and exaltations, for all its aspirant motion toward the realm of the aesthetic&#151;is also revealed as unable to quell strife and its attendant violence, as conducive to no just stability and, finally, as a desolation to its own greatest heroes (as the complaints and career of Achilles will dramatize). To the extent that it thematizes the obsolescence of the old heroic order, theIliadreveals an orientation toward the future; the poem cannot invent the forms that will govern the future, but it can present to the future a kind oftabula rasa, upon which the poet&#8217;s audience might reinscribe new meanings out of the wreckage of the old, upon which the heroes might be reassembled and once again directed toward human ends.If the warrior order is permanently unmade over the course of theIliad, it is upon the Shield of Achilles (XVIII.540&#150;681) that the poet depicts a collective way of life closer to the historical experience and communal ethos of his late eighth- or seventh-century audience. The Shield is forged by Hephaestus, the god of craft, at the request of Thetis, Achilles&#8217; mother. This new and immortal shield replaces Achilles&#8217; prior shield, which he had given to his beloved Patroclus, who lost it&#151;along with his life&#151;in combat with Hector, the Trojan prince and defender. In a distillation of pure fury following the death of Patroclus, Achilles has resolved to return to battle to avenge the death of Patroclus, with the full knowledge that his return will necessitate his death at Troy. When the Dawn-goddess delivers the gift of the Shield down from Olympus to Achilles&#8217; camp, his companions, upon seeing the images worked upon the Shield, are struck with fear and avert their gaze (XIX.16&#150;18). They cannot look upon the &#147;splendor&#8221; of the Shield, for in the depiction of the way of life there&#151;which is that of the poet&#8217;s own audience&#151;the heroes see their own obsolescence. Achilles, however, gazes long upon the brilliance of the Shield with a combination of adrenal anger and deep pleasure; his eyes gleam back in response, as if themselves afire. The vision that he sees upon the Shield&#151;of a world without heroes, of a world without the relentless martial strife of theIliaditself&#151;is the source of a renewed, visceral anger for Achilles because it is a world whose possibilities are not meant for him. Yet the vision is also a source of pleasure to him because it is of a world that his own great paroxysm of killing rage in the final quarter of the poem will usher in. In his pleasure at the sight of the Shield, Achilles can, as it were, acknowledge his own role in the foundation of the world to come, even if his role is preeminently one of extraordinary negation: Achilles is the hero whose discontent fully lays bare the failures of the heroic order from the point of view of mortal happiness, while his surpassing strength permits him to make that discontent murderously actual, as he devastates much of the heroic order itself in the final books of the poem. His perfection is such that he is both the culmination and the destruction of the traditional form.Among the images upon the Shield, it is the depiction of the wedding procession and, in the passage immediately following, of a communal process of adjudication in a case of murder that are foundational for the city-state (XVIII.554&#150;560 and 560&#150;574); both images appear on the second ring of the Shield, in the city at peace. In the wedding procession, the &#147;high-blazing&#8221; torches illumine a scene of music and revelry; the sight provokes wonder: The promise of the wedding&#151;which we do not see concluded, but always in motion&#151;is one of social unity, the joining together and mutual strengthening of families withinn the city. In theIliaditself, such unity is always in pieces, defended in speech even as it is sundered in action. The Achaean cause at Troy is, of course, the recovery of Helen, whose wedding to Menelaus is overturned by her flight, whether compelled or voluntary, to Troy. The martial expedition to Troy presents itself as a defense of the conjugal union and, by extension, of the social work that the wedding accomplishes&#151;primarily, the joining together of families and the establishment of a new social unit that might, in turn, offer guest-friendship to others and to outsiders, thus creating further links of social exchange and comity. And yet, as Achilles complains with great and piercing sarcasm in book IX, the larger social principle epitomized by the defense of Helen and her marriage has been granted no general applicability, but seems to apply only to Agamemnon and Menelaus.", "title": "The Iliad"}
{"description": "Grade 4-6.  Gory battles dominate this rendering of the ancient epic. A thorough prologue provides background details that set the story near the beginning of the Trojan War. Achilles, who is angry with Agamemnon, refuses to fight with the Greek army. After losing his best friend, he rejoins the battle and avenges Patroclus's death by killing Hector. Gods and goddesses join in the willful contests that propel this story. In a brief epilogue, the war ends with the infamous Trojan Horse; a helpful cast of characters is also included. Strachan carefully follows the action of the original story but eschews oral tradition and brings this version, which reads like a made-for-television movie script, into the '90s. The ancient bard relied heavily on epithets, metaphor, simile, and formalized language; Strachan has boiled out all the flavor of Homer. Well-executed, neo-classic illustrations that depict the action are generously spread throughout. Though the human figures look more European than Greek, the battle gear and costumes appear authentic, and Ambrus uses watercolor in striking ways to portray bloody battle scenes.

{"title": "The Journey", "description": "Leon Fleischer is the extraordinary pianist who lost the use of his right hand to a neurological ailment in 1964 at the height of his career. Undaunted, he took up teaching, conducting, and performing the left-hand literature so brilliantly that it was hard to believe he was using only one hand. When he returned to two-handed playing after years of medical treatments and determined, arduous rehabilitation, the public greeted him not only as a great artist but a conquering hero. This disc is his second two-handed recording (the first,Two Hands, was released in 2004). The title refers to the journey of life which, Fleischer says, \"matters more than the destinations.\" The program features works Fleischer had performed regularly before 1964 but never recorded. Now in his late 70s, Fleischer plays with patrician authority and an unfailing sense of structure and style. His technical mastery seems fully intact, his tone is beautiful and variable, his youthful vigor remarkable. His Bach is especially striking for its simple directness and the clarity of its texture and counterpoint. In the Capriccio \"On the Departure of a Brother,\" a piece of real \"program music,\" he brings out the lamentation and the humor; in the Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue the build-ups are very dramatic, the runs carefully shaped. Chopin's \"Berceuse\" is dreamy and singing.  Stravinsky's \"Serenade\" alternates percussive passages with sardonic \"melodies,\" and includes a marathon perpetual motion. An early, relatively unfamiliar Mozart sonata is fussy and unspontaneous, but Beethoven's very familiar \"F&#xFC;r Elise\" is beautiful. Is Fleischer demonstrating how this lovely piece, all too frequently heard on student recitals and telephones, should really sound?--Edith Eisler"}

Two Jewish sisters armed only with poorly forged papers escape a Polish ghetto; their real names are never given, and the narrator, the older sister, instead uses the various aliases they assume. Posing as Christians, they report to a transit camp to be sent to work in Germany. Danger is never far from them, however, and they are forced into a series of escapes and changes of identity. Fink excels at locating the tiny details that carry fatal consequences: Polish factory workers, suspecting the sisters, challenge them to sing Christmas carols; a farmhand doesn't contradict the narrator's claim to be an experienced milkmaid even when he sees the raw blisters on her hands; the narrator, still posing as a peasant, must concoct a cover story after she impulsively plays Chopin's \"Polonaise\" on the piano. The author's restrained, unsurprised tones suggest how routine, how everyday the brutalities of the Nazi regime must have seemed, even to its victims.

{"title": "The Promise", "description": "\"Once you have accepted your destiny, nothing can alter it unless rivers flow uphill, time runs backwards and the dead come back to life.\" --The Sorceress, Wuji-The Promise   As human beings, are we free to live out our lives according to our own desires, in accordance with our will, or are we merely powerless pawns in the hand of destiny? These are potent questions that in some way or another confront us all, sometimes in the most unexpected of ways. In a sense, I do believe that our fate is pre-determined. Yet paradoxically, I do not believe that this absolves us of our responsibility to try to alter it for the greater good, nor do I believe that fate has the final word. We might even say we are co-authors with fate of our destiny.   Of course, long before we began pre-production, I had conceptualized what the story would be: a beautiful Princess, a courageous Slave, an ambitious, charismatic Mighty General, an evil and cunning Duke, each propelled forward and entwined by vehement passions: greed, ambition, loyalty, revenge, the unremitting search for true love. Their dance with destiny would be choreographed not only by these powerful drives and desires, but also by promises and contracts made years before - each setting his or her own course for themselves earlier in life. Furthermore, I would set the story \"3,000 years ago in the future, somewhere in Asia.\" That was the essence of the film, the premise from which I started. Yet a series of synchronicitous events unfolded that shaped the film in distinct ways that I had not previously envisaged.   The film you \"plan\" to make is not the one which you shoot - the film will unfold as it will. Perhaps fate whispers stories to us in our dreams, in our subconscious, and we are compelled to tell them. And yet we do have an opportunity to shape them, to embellish them, to make them our own.--Chen Kaige"}

His body of work is small but masterful.  After an eight year hiatus from recording, Smith released this gorgeous, spare set of narratives and visions, featuring just him and his guitar.  His picking is warm and intricate, and his voice seems to come from some distant, peaceful and wise place.  His songs play along the widest scale of experience, from birth to death, both uncommon kindness and unbearable loneliness, in a language carefully whittled, always intense, first-hand, as if just pouring from him.--Ray Francis Kasten"}

{"description": "By now it's a clich&#xE9; to say that a great older singer's voice has mellowed like fine wine--but sometimes clich&#xE9;s are true, which is how they become clich&#xE9;s in the first place. Ray Price's solid-oak timbre and phrasing here suggest the experience and wisdom of a lounge singer while remaining stone country. Few others could do justice to the hard, complicated truths of \"You Just Don't Love Me Anymore\" or \"If It's All the Same to You,\" and Price proves he's earned an overwrought lyric like the title song simply by undersinging it. Produced by Nashville veteran Fred Foster, featuring old-hand sidemen who played on Price's shuffling early hits, and even including three songs written by fellow Texan Cindy Walker,Timedoesn't come across as nostalgic, but rather as the eloquent statement of a masterful artist who knows he's just not done quite yet, thank you.--John Morthland", "title": "Time"}
{"description": "Hugh Masekela has of late combined various styles of African music with funk, gospel, Latin and jazz into glossy, modern world pop. Masekela's first album of new material in three years, sticks with this fusion. As with other recent efforts, there are several vocal tracks, and while the South African chorus sounds great, Masekela's own raspy, somewhat tuneless lead vocals aren't quite so potent. Masekela's lyrics are forthright, although politics are now more personal than when he railed against apartheid. The highlight is still Masekela's trumpet and flugelhorn playing, which is supported by a fantastic brass section and rhythm players who're versed in smooth-jazz grooves and Latin rhythms.--Tad Hendrickson", "title": "Time"}

{"description": "Sinewy, trashed and poetic, Richard Hell was the apotheosis of New York punk, as this double-disc release shows; it's a suitably ragged catalog of his work beyondTelevisionand 1977's marvelous Voidoids LP,Blank Generation. Disc 1 begins in 1975, with four tracks from Hell's short stint in the Heartbreakers alongsideJohnny Thunders. There's a first attempt at the seminal \"Love Comes in Spurts\" and a grizzled, heartfelt version of Dee Dee Ramone's junkie prayer, \"Chinese Rocks.\" But Thunders's guitar playing sounds trad and clumsy next to the wiry garage art of Robert Quine, who drives some pretty spunky Voidoids tracks. It's these that prove the Voidoids, of the CBGB generation, sound most like the Strokes. Four from 1984, withMetersdrummer Ziggy Modeliste and a skronky sax player on board, act as a curious epilogue to this brief, incendiary career. Hell dispassionately abandoned rock & roll for writing and left his legend to grow largely untainted by bad records. A 1977 London gig provides the bulk of Disc 2. The sound quality is shockingly bad, but it's clear the Voidoids had, fleetingly, a wild, mercurial genius most bands only dream of, even when ritually massacring \"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\" A year later in New York,Elvis Costelloturns up to bellow \"You Gotta Lose.\" Like most things here, it's a phenomenal mess.

{"description": "Timeglowingly demonstrates Lionel Richie's ability to write and sing socially relevant tracks. However, much of the luster from his mid-'80s heyday is woefully absent. Perhaps it's the album's darker thematic hue that robs the project of the once-familiar Richie magic. &quot;Zoomin'&quot; is a melancholy-laced track that addresses world problems, and &quot;Everytime&quot; bears a sobering timbre that explores relationships' more stark realities. Conversely, the title track rings with a warm pop melody of hope, while &quot;Closest Thing to Heaven&quot; boasts dreamy, feel-good lyrics. As usual, the artist's music deftly blurs the boundaries between pop, R&B;, and country music, underscoring Richie's award-winning universal creative approach. Still, one comes away with a hungry feeling, as if Richie has yet to regain his stride following his lengthy self-imposed recording exile.--J.R. Reynolds", "title": "Time"}

A concept album (a brave undertaking in 1981),Timehas a space-age theme and is set at the end of the 21st century. What's most remarkable is how all this science-fiction silliness is salvaged by the exuberant playing. \"Yours Truly, 2095\" uses a number of ELO's hallmarks--a catchy synth riff, sweeping strings, and over-the-top production--to tell a tale of a man in love with a robot; the album's highlight, it should have been a hit single. The epic \"Twilight\" and \"Hold on Tight\"--which practically bounces along like an overexcited puppy--also stand among ELO's finest works.

{"title": "Time", "description": "Whether measured in minutes or eons, time is a good friend of British artist Andy Goldsworthy's. He spends long, solitary days outdoors in all kinds of weather, doing things like piecing together many, many yellow leaves to create a brilliant band of color at a river's edge in upstate New York or stacking small pieces of ice on the Nova Scotia coast to build a sculpture in the compact shape of an ancient stone monument. Threatened by a strong gust of wind, the incoming tide, or a sudden rise in temperature, these are fugitive works comfortably in synch with the natural rhythms of growth and decay.Other works of his are longer-lasting. In walls made of stacked stones with hollowed-out oval \"chambers\" the size of his body--which he began building in 1999 in Lancashire, England--Goldsworthy makes reference not only to the shapes of graves in a nearby church but also to his personal history in the region and the enduring qualities of a rugged landscape.Goldsworthy is the rare artist who can describe what he does in simple, concrete terms that nonetheless reveal his larger vision.Timeis a very satisfying collection of 500 photographs, nearly all taken by him, that document the creation and subsequent mutations of his work. These evocative images are illuminated by excerpts from the diaries he kept as he created five projects in Europe and North America in the '90s. He discusses what it's like to explore an unfamiliar landscape, assess how the elements will work for and against him, and perform what are essentially a set of experiments. Success means making work that is, as he writes, \"completely welded to its site.\"--Cathy Curtis--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}

{"description": "Turned down as a marketing problem because it couldn't be \"labeled\" 10 years ago, this novel will almost certainly be another of Leonard's big hits. He writes in the sparse, word-perfect prose style that distinguishes Glitz, Bandits and all his bestsellers to tell a tender, funny, suspenseful story. The hero, Charlie Lawson, once served as Brother Juvenal in a Catholic order; now he cares for alcoholics in a Detroit hospice. Charlie/Juvenal cures those he touches through miracles manifested by the Stigmata, the wounds of Christ that appear on Charlie's body. The phenomenon lures a flashy promoter, Bill Hill, aiming to get rich by exploiting the reclusive, gentle man who is also the intended prey of rabid right-winger August Murray. Murray plans to get the healer on his side, fighting against the ecumenism of Vatican II rules, especially the ones forbidding the Mass being said in Latin. Both Hill and Murray are losers when smart, attractive Lynn Faulkner and Charlie fall in love, before the astonishing finale that makes one believe the couple will live happily ever after.

{"description": "Although only nineteen years old, this precocious redhead unleashes more sass and ambiguity in her voice than a woman twice her age. Fierce and musically assured, Bonnie McKee is a pop alternative toAvril Lavigne, traversing some of the same lyrical territory as the Canadian punk thrush but with more emotional intelligence and grit--quite an accomplishment since McKee didn't employ the glossy talents of the Matrix, or anyone else for that matter--the singer penned all twelve tracks herself. With a vocal range on par withChristina Aguilera, McKee manages to go from kittenish to feral in the space of a single song, and always seems to end up on top, no matter how many times she stumbles. \"When It All Comes Down\" may be the sound of heartbreak, but McKee refuses to wallow in her pain and plots her own eventual recovery in the space of a single song. By rights, this should be the anthem for anyone attempting to get over a breakup--without appearing to. \"Confessions of a Teenage Girl,\" is so winsome and engaging, it could inspire a Fox TV show. But Bonnie McKee has talent to burn, so it wouldn't be a surprise if that's already in the works. Paired withGreen Dayproducer, Rob Cavallo, McKee elevates post-teen rebellion and broken romance to high art--and this is only the beginning of what she's capable of. --Jaan Uhelszki", "title": "Trouble"}
{"description": "Christensen followsThe Great Manwith this slightly lesser work, a coming-of-middle-age novel that explores the sexual lives of three women in their 40s. Best friends since their college days, trust-funder Indrani, therapist Josie and L.A. rocker Raquel are like three very different but close sisters. After flirting with a man at a New York party, Josie realizes that she is sexually starving and decides to leave her husband, though Indrani thinks it's a terrible move. Meanwhile, on the left coast, the nearly washed-up ex-junkie Raquel becomes embroiled in a scandal when she's smeared as the other woman to a young actor with a pregnant girlfriend. Raquel hightails it to Mexico City and begs a less than-reluctant Josie to join her. From here the novel takes a predictable route as the women drink their way across the city, Raquel spirals further out of control, and Josie's inner vixen is awakened. The novel loses some of its mojo in the location change&mdash;Mexico City seems just out of focus&mdash;but the characters are marvelously realized, and when Christensen's on a roll, her wit is irresistible.(June)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

{"description": "Grade 7&ndash;10&mdash;Gary D. Schmidt's novel (Clarion, 2008) presents the story of an upper class New England family's privileged life colliding with violent prejudices against immigrant Cambodians after a tragic accident. Franklin is hit and killed by a pickup truck driven by Chay, a Cambodian student in Franklin's prep school. Chay is not sent to jail, and racial tensions are sparked. Franklin and his younger brother, Henry, had planned to climb Mt. Katahdin in Maine. Henry is determined to make the climb, and one morning the boy, his best friend, and a stray dog decide to hitchhike to the mountain and are picked up by Chay. Prejudice takes on a different face entirely as Chay's personal story develops, entwined with all three boys' growing understanding of their families, their town, and what really happened the night of the accident. Jason Culp's accomplished reading moves smoothly from a quiet and neutral narration to vivid vocal depictions of each character, complete with seamless accents. This gripping, adventure-filled journey of self discovery and exploration of themes such as discrimination and forgiveness will appeal to middle and high school students.&mdash;Jane P.

{"description": "Over the years, accordion and keyboard player Stanley \"Buckwheat\" Dural Jr. has extended his sphere of influence far beyond southern Louisiana and East Texas. Today Dural's still going strong; he's even releasing this album on his very own record label. Central to his allure as a singer and instrumentalist is how fascinatingly Dural works his cadences into the mighty file-seasoned grooves conjured by world-class bassist Lee Allen Zeno and drummer Kevin Menard, who are lent able assistance by horns, a rhythm guitarist, a second keyboardist, and a washboard player. Songs written by Dural (or cowritten with his longtime manager Ted Fox) have all the let-the-good-times-roll exuberance suggested by titles like \"Hard Chargin',\" \"Hard to Stop,\" and \"Put It in the Pocket.\" The rhythms cool down only for the unabashedly charming \"Do You Remember the Time?\" Dural's one misstep is subverting the poignant storytelling aspect of the Robert Johnson classic \"Crossroads\" in the name of fun.

Others (Van Morrison, Neil Young) seem to have sprung from out of nowhere with the fully formed soul of a life well-lived. Ray LaMontagne belongs with the latter. On this, his debut, LaMontagne has crafted a handful of quietly devastating meditations on life and love--and delivered them with a raspy vocal all his own. The simple, mournful lyrics of \"Burn,\" \"Shelter\" and the title track recall a Hank Williams ballad, and the reserved production by alt-country/americana genius Ethan Johns (the Jayhawks, Ryan Adams, Kings of Leon) make this a great disc for smoky Saturday nights, and rainy Sunday mornings.--Ben Heege", "title": "Trouble"}

{"description": "Back in print for the first time since 2005, this novel by the author of the Autumn and Hater series tackles one of the oldest themes in science fiction: first contact. Their vessel irreparably damaged, an alien mining crew comes to Earth in the hopes of remaining here until their homeworld can send out a ship to pick them up. Tom Winter, the story&#x2019;s protagonist (hero doesn&#x2019;t seem quite the right word), is immediately suspicious because, let&#x2019;s face it, everything the aliens are doing&#x2014;sharing scientific and medical advances, for example&#x2014;is straight out of the alien-invasion playbook. Are the aliens really up to no good, or is Tom just being paranoid? The writing is not as visceral as Moody&#x2019;s popular postapocalyptic novels, but that isn&#x2019;t a bad thing: this story, with its slowly building sense of unease and multiple thematic undercurrents (probably the best being the frequent references to popular fictional alien-invasion stories by way of illustrating how our perceptions often conform to our expectations), needs a more delicate touch.

And they all tell the story of his growth as a performer. As the years and tunes tumble by, King's guitar solos become more expansive and adventurous, and his cross-genre experiments, like 1987's \"When Love Come to Town\" with U2, grow bolder. \"I'll Survive,\" also featured here, has become King's late-career theme song, but as he heads toward his 80th birthday on September 16, 2005--still playing 150 concerts a year with his vastly influential guitar skills sharp and his voice just a bit weathered--King's version of survival contains genuine majesty.--Ted Drozdowski"}

Winners of the first Grammy Award for best reggae album (forAnthem), Black Uhuru tookBob Marley's punching rhythms and hardened them further, thanks to the duo ofbassist Robbie Shakespeare and drummer Sly Dunbar.

This generous 77-minute set of classic Uhuru includes the major points: \"I Love King Selassie,\" \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" \"Utterance,\" \"Youth of Eglington.\" The melodic flow and harmony-vocal crosscut of the lattermost tune stood far and away above so much reggae of the era with an adroit mix of old-school rootsiness and creative expression. Alas, the lineup that cut the tune would break apart gradually, first with the 1984 departure of Rose (replaced by Junior Reed), and then in 1986 with the departure of Jones--who succumbed to cancer in 1990. The vast majority of these 17 tracks, though, come from the Rose/Island Records era, and for that, the collection indeed amounts to \"ultimate\" as its title claims.--Andrew Bartlett", "title": "Ultimate Collection"}

{"title": "Ultimate Collection", "description": "Considered by some pundits as having played second fiddle to the lofty mainstream success of Motown's Diana Ross and the Supremes, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas (initially Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard, who was replaced by Betty Kelly in 1964) had a grittier sound that may not have given them the same kind of pop following accorded label founder Berry Gordy Jr.'s \"pet\" group. But as this 25-track compilation demonstrates, former Motown secretary Reeves and her cohorts hardly languished in obscurity. Rather, the team--with the assistance of Motown producers like Mickey Stevenson and the formidable Holland-Dozier-Holland trio--provided the musical soundtrack for the '60s with such classics as \"Heat Wave,\" \"Dancing in the Street,\" \"Nowhere to Run,\" and their first hit, 1963's \"Come and Get These Memories.\" While it doesn't have every one of the group's 24 charted hits, this collection includes all of their major smashes, some notable B-sides (\"A Love Like Yours,\" \"Forget Me Not,\" \"Motoring,\" and the much-loved \"Third Finger, Left Hand\"), and some interesting obscurities, such as 1970's \"I Should Be Proud\" (a poorly disguised Vietnam protest) and \"Tear It On Down,\" the group's final chart single. A perfect, essential overview of one of Motown's most prized and admired female groups.--David Nathan"}

Unfortunately, The Ultimate Collection omits later gems such as &quot;Keeper of the Castle,&quot; &quot;Ain't No Woman,&quot; and &quot;When She Was My Girl,&quot; but that leaves room to delve into the unique partnership between the Tops and their songwriting triumvirate.--Marc Greilsamer"}

Banton has a remarkably wide musical  range, and selections such as \"No Respect,\" which features a sonically  complex digital production, \"Untold Stories,\" an introspective song  backed by a simply strummed acoustic guitar, and \"Hills and Valleys,\"  with its old-style roots feel, demonstrate his mastery of most of  reggae's musical offshoots.

This collection does boast a lovely cover ofBadfinger's \"Baby Blue,\" while Mann originals like \"That's Just What You Are,\" \"Amateur,\" and \"Long Shot\" (all fromI'm With Stupid) still sound great.

{"description": "Motown's \"girl with the golden voice\" actually spent only four of her 22 career years as a chart maker for the Detroit diskery, but Mary Wells was truly the Motor City machine's first bona fide solo female star. \"Bye Bye Baby,\" the first track on this fine 25-cut compilation, was written by a teenage Wells for then-superstar Jackie Wilson; while she managed to get it to Berry Gordy Jr., the author of many of Wilson's earliest hits, she didn't know that it would give her the first of 10 consecutive hits of her own. This collection provides a comprehensive overview of Wells's Motown years and is an essential purchase. Here are the obvious classics: the perennial \"My Guy,\" written and produced by Smokey Robinson; the equally timeless \"You Beat Me to the Punch\"; the unforgettable \"Two Lovers\"; and the marvelous \"One Who Really Loves You.\" But then there are some other wonderful inclusions, such as \"I'll Be Available\" and \"When I'm Gone,\" two scheduled but never-issued singles; the equally obscure \"Whisper You Love Me Boy\" (redone by vanilla Motown diva Chris Clark); the hidden gem \"Goodbye and Good Luck\"; and some great B-sides. Duets with Marvin Gaye (\"What's the Matter with You Baby\" and \"Once upon a Time\") and three post-Motown hits (\"Use Your Head,\" \"Never, Never Leave Me,\" and \"Dear Lover\") make this a must for those wanting a comprehensive package of the singer's early years.--David Nathan", "title": "Ultimate Collection"}
{"title": "Ultimate Collection", "description": "Native American flutist Douglas Spotted Eagle dedicates this album to children as part of his efforts to support the prevention of child abuse. The result is a compilation of Spotted Eagle's strongest material, beginning with the very emotional \"The Traveler,\" a piece the composer wrote after his children were taken from him. Rife with soothing cedar flute, this album sets an expansive, spiritual mood slow in tempo and sparse in instrumentation. Native chant and drums fill out the swaths of long, lush flute, ambient synth, and chiming guitar. \"Daddy's Arms,\" though an emotionally meaningful song for what seems to be divorced and absent fathers, is definitely the odd pick out. Spotted Eagle is not a trained singer, and the tune would have benefited from one, especially since the featured instrumentation is piano &#xE0; laJim Brickman. Outside of this small peculiar blip at the CD's end, this album is a respectable collection of beautiful Native flute music that emits a centered, calming energy.--Karen K. Hugg"}

{"description": "Vannelli's incredible string of hit recordings, and his renowned gifts as a vocalist, composer, and lyricist place him in a league with the great interpreters of popular song. Throughout his career, Vannelli has explored new modes of expression, from his ground breaking 1970s work with synthesizers to his current recording, Slow Love, which marks a new peak in the singer's evolution.Vannelli's pursuit of his musical vision eventually led to his 1978 breakthrough commercial triumph, the platinum-selling Brother to Brother, featuring the #1 pop success, \"I Just Wanna Stop\".  Vannelli, along with his brothers Joe and Ross, had by now earned five consecutive Juno awards as Canada's Top Male Vocalist, Producer, and Engineer of the Year, respectively.  Gino also received another Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance.  1981 heralded Vannelli's most adventurous album to date, Nightwalker, with its incredibly popular single \"Living Inside Myself\" (and a fourth Grammy nomination).  He followed with the platinum-selling Black Cars in the mid-80s, and then Big Dreamers Never Sleep (recorded at his Blue Moon Studios).Gino Vannelli: Ultimate Collection is the first career-spanning compilation that includes his recordings from A&M; and Arista Records.", "title": "Ultimate Collection"}

{"description": "With their glorious three-part harmonies and sophisticated musical  arrangements, the Sons of the Pioneers more or less defined the genre known as  Western music. Hip-O's hour-long, 21-track compilation is a superb overview,  containing the best of the group's Decca, Vocalion, RCA Victor, and Coral  recordings from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Formed in Los Angeles in the 1930s,  the earliest version of the Pioneers comprised guitarist Leonard Slye (later  known asRoy Rogers),  bassist Bob Nolan, and singer Tim Spencer. Later members included the brothers  Karl and Hugh Farr, who created the group's signature (and surpassingly jazzy)  guitar and fiddle instrumentation, with its echoes ofEddie LangandJoe Venuti; bassist Pat  Brady; and singers Lloyd Perryman and Tommy Doss. Despite the personnel changes,  the group's rich sound never wavered, and their mournful, melancholic evocation  of the Old West on such classics as \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds,\" \"Blue Prairie,\"  \"Cool Water,\" and \"Riders in the Sky\" is pure Americana.--David Hill", "title": "Ultimate Collection"}

{"title": "Very Best of", "description": "Although there have been countless compilations over the decades, The Very Best of the Jacksons could well be the most definitive. Split across two discs, disc one primarily features the early Mowtown days and the second, mainly their hits as the Jacksons (as opposed to Jackson 5) released on Epic. Often overshadowed by Michael's subsequent success as a solo artist, this anthology demonstrates why the Jacksons' perfect balance of pop and soul has endured when compared to one-time peers such as the Osmonds. The irresistible funk of 'ABC' and 'I Want You Back' are classics of the period as are the incredible ballads 'Got to Be There' and little Michael's ode to a loveable rodent, 'Ben'. Highlights of disc two are predominantly from their massive albums Destiny and Triumph, released in the late 1970s, early 1980s; 'Can You Feel it', 'Blame it on the Boogie' and 'Shake Your Body' to name but three. It was around this time that Michael began his adult solo career and The Very Best of the Jacksons appropriately ends with a live version of \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\" from MJ's Off the Wall. Michael may have gone on to eclipse his family but there can be little dispute that the Jacksons are one of the most important musical dynasties ever. Sony. 2004."}

{"description": "Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was certainly one of the greatest singers of her own, or indeed any other time. An obsessive perfectionist, her flawless technique and intonation over a huge range, vocal flexibility, breath control, phrasing, stylistic versatility, and above all her focused, radiantly beautiful sound were matchless and incomparable. All these are on full display on this generous 2-CD set, which features over a dozen arias, songs by Schubert, Wolf and Richard Strauss, and some lighter fare. The recordings were made between 1950 and 1967, and the singing becomes better and better, the voice richer and more varied, the expression deeper and more immediate. Not surprisingly, the peaks come in the arias from her signature roles in Mozart'sFigaro,Don Giovanni, andCosi fan tutte; Richard Strauss'Ariadne,Rosenkavalier, andArabella, which rise to real ecstasy; and arias from Weber'sFreisch&#xFC;tzand Smetana'sBartered Bride, which are wonderfully intimate and touching. She is less convincing in roles she never sang on stage, and the \"childish\" voice she cultivated especially forH&#xE4;nsel and Gretelis unnatural and contrived. The same is true of the last two \"popular\" numbers, which sound condescending and artificial. The songs, however, have all her customary finesse and inwardness; the Wolf group, perhaps chosen for its gentle humor, is charming, while Strauss' \"Four Last Songs\" (represented by two) shimmer and soar.  Schwarzkopf's singing had instantly recognizable characteristics: a tendency to hold back both vocally and emotionally, giving a sense of noble restraint, but also of cool detachment; excessive use of color and nuance, creating a fussy, calculated and somewhat artificial air. Only rarely does she \"let go\" with full voice and spontaneous feeling. However, as these recordings show, she invariably inspires admiration and captures ear and heart through the inimitable, glorious beauty of her voice.--Edith Eisler", "title": "Very Best of"}

{"description": "In the late '80s and early '90s, David Wilcox rose quickly through the  burgeoning ranks of singer-songwriters on the strength of his emotionally  observant writing, butterscotch voice, and elegant, sophisticated guitar work.  This compilation draws from the three albums he made for A&M--from; the sparsely  producedHow Did You Find Me  Here(1989) through the increasingly band-orientedHome Again(1991) andBig Horizon(1994)--and  does, in fact, include some of his best work, from the vivid biker's tale \"Eye  of the Hurricane\" to the bitingly funny \"Advertising Man\" to the chilling  drugs/sex analogy of \"Strong Chemistry.\" A couple of live tracks culled from  promo EPs (\"Daddy's Money\" and \"Johnny's Camaro\") plus one unreleased studio  variation (\"That's What the Lonely Is For\") are nice but minor enticements for  those who already own the original albums.

An earnest late-'70s country rocker, she evolved into a sophisticated singer-songwriter whose blend of traditional country and mainstream folk and literate, dark worldview anticipated alt.country decades before it emerged. This 1983-2003 anthology includes her debut hit \"No Memories Hangin' 'Round,\" a 1979 duet with Bobby Bare. While \"My Baby Thinks He's a Train,\" the 1981 rockabilly twanger first recorded by Asleep at the Wheel, seemed to herald a retro direction, Cash confounded those who would speculate on her direction. She complemented compelling originals like \"Seven Year Ache\" and \"Blue Moon with Heartache\" with her definitive rendition of John Hiatt's \"The Way We Make a Broken Heart\" and a crisp revival of her dad's 1961 hit \"Tennessee Flat Top Box.\" The set also samples her songwriting collaborations with former husband Rodney Crowell and current husband-producer John Leventhal.

{"title": "Very Best of", "description": "Recorded between 1994 & 2001. Includes liner notes by Jonathan Widran.

A soft-toned player of the Spanish guitar, Antoine has a gift for intricate yet non-complex playing as well as strong melodies, and his compositions occasionally reveal a surprising depth (if only he'd delegate the drum-programming duties to someone beside himself). This 12-track collection, The Very Best of Marc Antoine, spans five of his LPs for GRP, beginning with \"Latin Quarter,\" (far and away his best performance). None of the rest rise above the level of Muzak, though the addition of live drummer Lil' John Roberts for \"On the Strip\" makes a big difference, and Antoine summons a bit of magic for the title track of Cruisin'."}

They  scored 11 R&B; top 30 singles, but the fact that they had four lead  vocalists couldn't have helped cement their image, and neither can  their range of material, from funk-pop stomps (\"Car Wash,\" \"Do Your  Dance\") to smoldering slow ones. Originally assembled by psychedelic  soul controller Norman Whitfield as a post-Motown project, the group  gradually drifted from disco downpours to Quiet Storm drizzle. After  their full-throttle debut with theCar Washsoundtrack, diminishing  returns set in, though this compilation cherry picks the good album  tracks from later records as well as the hits. But Whitfield's presence  insured that there was usually something unconventional happening in  the mix--check the Space Invaders bass on the ballad \"Love Don't Live  Here Anymore\"--and the songs Whitfield and his stable handed them were  powerful and resonant, including the original versions ofMary J.

{"title": "Very Best of", "description": "The \"5\" Royales are often referred to as the forerunners of Soul music.  Their southern heritage and background in gospel music served them well when they made the switch to secular music.  One of the bluesiest vocal groups of their era, their records sold like crazy when they exploded on the music scene in 1952 on Apollo Records.  Securing their sevices on King Records, which is where the songs on this CD are from, was considered a major coup in 1954.  They were so popular at the time that their move to King required a lesser-known group which had been recording for King's Federal subsidiary without much success to that point, The Royals, to change their name to The Midnighters to avoid further confusion.  Unable to make the switch to the Soul era, the \"5\" Royales disbanded in the late 1960s.  It was a sad ending for a group wich had been at the top for longer than almost any other TRUE R&B; group of the 1950s, and one that should have been able to weather the transition from R&B; to Soul like The Dells and The Four Tops did.

{"title": "Very Best of", "description": "Through the first half of the '70s, and intermittently thereafter, Willie Hutch was the closest thing the Motown stable had to aCurtis Mayfield, from his cool, guitar-and-percussion based soul numbers (and the strings that sweetened them) on down to his cap and shades. An ace songwriter who'd cowritten \"I'll Be There\" for theJackson 5, he followed Mayfield's path into scoring movies--Foxy BrownandThe Mack(for which he wrote the enduring \"Brother's Gonna Work It Out\")--but his voice was earthier, more in theSam Cooketradition, and his lyrics were more concerned with the redemptive power of love than with street terror.  This smart career condensation also jumps forward for his '82 dance-floor semi-hit \"In and Out.\"--Douglas Wolk"}
{"title": "Very Best of", "description": "Timi Yuro was an American soul and R&B; singer. She signed to Liberty when she was 18 years old and had an immediate hit with her 1st single \"Hurt\". She was often compared to Dinah Washington and Brenda Lee and she supported Frank Sinatra on his 1962 tour of Australia. This long awaited collection is packed with great songs including \"Hurt\",\"Fever\",\"Smile\",\"You'll Never Know\",\"Make The World Go Away\", \"Stardust\" and \"Hallelujah I Love Him So\"."}
{"description": "Toots Hibbert is often compared toOtis Redding, and since Hibbert was greatly influenced by classic American R&B; as well as the music of his own Baptist church, that comparison is certainly apt. But while he owes a debt to the intense, high-octane vocal approach of Redding, there is also a great deal of similarity between Toots and the greatJames Brown. In many ways and at roughly the same time, Hibbert did for Jamaican soul what Brown did for its American cousin--he made it funky andnasty! One listen to the chunky guitar riffs underneath and Hibbert's repetitive vocal chants on top of 1968's \"Do the Reggay\" and this much is clear: while the energy of ska remains, the deepgroovehas become supreme ruler. This awesome collection goes back to an early Prince Buster-produced single from 1964 and follows the Maytals--and with them, the history of Jamaican pop--from sweet-harmonizing, horn-driven ska to steadfast rock steady to archetypical roots reggae. And don't forget that Hibbert wrote 18 of these 19 jewels himself (there's one Redding cover here), showing himself to be highly effective with both topical tunes and cheerful rave-ups.--Marc Greilsamer", "title": "Very Best of"}

{"title": "Wanted", "description": "Seeing his own face on a wanted poster is more than a little disconcerting to a man who has devoted his life to upholding the law, not breaking it.  Separated at birth, Texas Ranger Morgan Davis has no idea that the man he is sworn to bring in for murder is his twin, Nicholas.  Nicholas Braden knows he did not kill the man in Harmony, TX in cold blood, but convincing the cold, unfeeling, duty-bound lawman of that is impossible.  Even Nick's sister Lorilee, who has always been able to wrap men around her little finger, is met with a cold shoulder.  Lori will do anything to free her brother, and went her feminine charms don't work, Lori tries to ambush the Ranger, seriously wounding him.  A crack shot, Lori aimed for his shoulder and hit it, but Morgan is convinced she tried to kill him.  Chained together for the duration of the journey, Nick comes to hate Morgan more fiercely each day.  Lori comes to understand Morgan's unrelenting nature, his duty to a job that has become a way of life, and respects him for his convictions.  Lori is soon torn between her love and loyalty for her brother, and her unsettling feelings for the Ranger.  The uncanny resemblance between the two men causes many questions and concerns, and although Morgan is angry over seeing his face on the wanted posters, he starts to realize that Nick could not be the killer he is accused of being.  Determined to get to the bottom of all these mysteries, Morgan tries desperately to trust Lori and Nick.  But can he? Or will Nick and Lori's desperate flight for freedom make them betray Morgan again?  And should Morgan reveal his suspicions about his relationship to Nick, the man who has come to hate him so, or let him go on believing that the family he has been raised with is really his own?The name Patricia Potter assures a great novel!

{"title": "Wanted", "description": "This single-volume trilogy of connected short stories will be a quick read for shojo fans. Armeria is a girl with a powerful singing voice; while performing for a wealthy family, she falls in love with the handsome Luce, only to see him captured by pirates a short time later. Eight years pass, and she comes across the ship that took her love and manages to sneak aboard disguised as a boy. It's not long before she's outed, though, and soon discovers why Captain Skulls, the handsome pirate with the heart of gold, looks so familiar. To call Skulls's identity a twist or a surprise is being overly kind, but this is a book that is more about emotion and the exploration of longing than about any real plot emphasis. The third chapter, however, does revolve around an interesting story idea, a piece of music that appears to be cursed. Throwaway running commentaries from the author (I did study the various historical backgrounds, but I've ignored them to make things convenient) are a bit of a distraction, but romantic-minded readers won't be bothered by them, and instead will enjoy her lush detailed art.(Sept.)Copyright &copy; Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Add 5\" to that measurement and round up to the next even number. This measurement is your band size. If your under bust measures 30.8\", your band size is 36.Step 2: Recheck your band sizeTo double-check your band size, measure around your torso where the front bra straps begin. If this measurement is close to the band size (36), then your measurements are accurate.Step 3: Find your cup sizePlease measure loosely around the fullest part of your bust. Subtract the under bust measurement (30.8\") from the full bust measurement (suppose it is 38.5\") and get the difference (7.7\"), which is your cup size. (4.7 to 5.5\" A cup, 5.5 to 6.3\" B cup, 6.3 to 7.1\" C, 7.1 to 7.8\" D, 7.8 to 8.7\" DD, 8.7 to 9.5\" DDD). From the list, we know your cup size is D (7.1 to 7.8\" D), so your bra size is 36D (US size)."}
